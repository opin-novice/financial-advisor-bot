## 🚀 The Big Picture: How Everything Connects

Think of this system like a **smart library** with a **helpful librarian**:

1. **Documents come in** → Get processed and organized
2. **You ask a question** → The system finds relevant information
3. **Smart processing happens** → Your question gets better answers
4. **Response is generated** → You get a helpful answer in your language

## 🔄 How Information Flows Through the System

### **Step 1: Document Processing**
```
PDF Files → extract_pdf_text.py → pdf_preprocessor.py → docadd.py → faiss_index/
```

### **Step 2: Question Processing**
```
Your Question → telegram_bot.py → bot_core.py → language_utils.py (detects language)
```

### **Step 3: Document Search**
```
Question → document_retriever.py → searches faiss_index/ → finds relevant documents
```

### **Step 4: Document Ranking**
```
Found Documents → document_ranker.py → ranks by relevance → sends best ones forward
```

### **Step 5: Answer Generation**
```
Best Documents → response_generator.py → generates answer → language_utils.py (translates if needed)
```

### **Step 6: Response Delivery**
```
Final Answer → bot_core.py → telegram_bot.py → sends to you on Telegram
```

## 🧩 How Files Depend on Each Other

### **Core Dependencies (What Must Work First)**
1. `config.py` - Everything else needs settings from here
2. `setup_nltk.py` + `setup_ollama.py` - Must run first to install tools
3. `docadd.py` - Must run to create the searchable database

### **Main Flow Dependencies**
1. `main.py` starts `telegram_bot.py`
2. `telegram_bot.py` uses `bot_core.py`
3. `bot_core.py` coordinates between all other components

### **Data Dependencies**
1. `data/` folder must contain documents
2. `faiss_index/` must be created by `docadd.py`
3. `.env` must contain API keys and settings

## 🚨 What Happens If Something Breaks

### **If `config.py` breaks:**
- Nothing works - it's like losing the instruction manual

### **If `bot_core.py` breaks:**
- The system can't coordinate between components

### **If `document_retriever.py` breaks:**
- Can't find relevant documents to answer questions

### **If `response_generator.py` breaks:**
- Can't generate answers even with good documents

### **If `language_utils.py` breaks:**
- Can't detect languages or translate responses

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Think of this system like a **well-oiled machine** where:
- **Each file has a specific job** (like workers in a factory)
- **Files work together** (like an assembly line)
- **Information flows in one direction** (question → search → answer)
- **Everything depends on everything else** (like a chain reaction)

The beauty is that each piece does what it's best at, and together they create a powerful system that can understand your questions and give you helpful answers in your preferred language!

**Problem**: Can't find documents
**Check**: `docadd.py` → `faiss_index/` → `document_retriever.py`

**Problem**: Language detection not working
**Check**: `setup_nltk.py` → `language_utils.py`

**Problem**: No AI responses
**Check**: `setup_ollama.py` → `response_generator.py`

*This system is designed to be robust - if one part has a problem, the others can often still work, giving you a graceful degradation rather than a complete failure.*
