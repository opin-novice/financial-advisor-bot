# RAGAS Evaluation Improvement Guide

## Current Score Analysis

Your current scores show significant issues:

```
Sample 1: context_precision: NaN, context_recall: 1.0000, faithfulness: 0.5000, answer_relevancy: 0.7509
Sample 2: context_precision: NaN, context_recall: 0.0000, faithfulness: NaN, answer_relevancy: 0.3990  
Sample 3: context_precision: 0.0000, context_recall: 0.0000, faithfulness: NaN, answer_relevancy: 0.2881
```

### ❌ **Problems Identified:**
1. **Multiple NaN values** - Indicates evaluation failures
2. **Low context_precision (0.0000)** - Retrieved contexts are not relevant
3. **Poor context_recall (0.0000 for 2/3 samples)** - Missing important context
4. **Low faithfulness (0.5000)** - Generated answers contradict the context
5. **Declining answer_relevancy** - Answers becoming less relevant to questions

## Understanding RAGAS Metrics

### 1. **Context Precision** (Target: >0.8)
- **What it measures**: Relevance of retrieved contexts to the question
- **Current issue**: NaN/0.0000 - Retrieved contexts are irrelevant
- **Good score**: >0.8

### 2. **Context Recall** (Target: >0.8) 
- **What it measures**: Whether all relevant contexts were retrieved
- **Current issue**: 0.0000 for most samples - Missing important information
- **Good score**: >0.8

### 3. **Faithfulness** (Target: >0.8)
- **What it measures**: Whether the answer is grounded in the retrieved context
- **Current issue**: 0.5000/NaN - Answers contradict or ignore context
- **Good score**: >0.8

### 4. **Answer Relevancy** (Target: >0.8)
- **What it measures**: How well the answer addresses the question
- **Current issue**: Declining scores (0.75→0.40→0.29) - Quality degradation
- **Good score**: >0.8

## Improvement Strategies

### 🔍 **1. Fix Context Retrieval (Context Precision & Recall)**

#### A. Improve Embedding Quality
```python
# Try better embedding models
EMBEDDING_MODELS = [
    "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",           # Fast, good quality
    "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",          # High quality
    "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2",  # Multilingual
    "BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5",                          # State-of-the-art
]
```

#### B. Optimize Retrieval Parameters
```python
# In your build_retriever() function:
return vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr",  # Maximum Marginal Relevance for diversity
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 8,           # Increase from 5 to 8
        "fetch_k": 20,    # Fetch more candidates
        "lambda_mult": 0.5  # Balance relevance vs diversity
    }
)
```

#### C. Improve Document Chunking
```python
# Better chunking strategy
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=512,        # Smaller chunks for better precision
    chunk_overlap=100,     # More overlap for continuity
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " "]  # Better split points
)
```

### 🎯 **2. Enhance Answer Generation (Faithfulness)**

#### A. Improve Your RAG Prompt
```python
IMPROVED_RAG_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based ONLY on the provided context.

STRICT RULES:
1. Base your answer ONLY on the provided context
2. If the context doesn't contain enough information, say "The provided context doesn't contain sufficient information to answer this question"
3. Quote relevant parts of the context when possible
4. Do not add information from your general knowledge

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer based strictly on the context above:
"""
```

#### B. Use Higher Quality LLM
```python
# Try different models for better faithfulness
GROQ_MODELS = [
    "llama3-70b-8192",      # More capable than 8b
    "mixtral-8x7b-32768",   # Good reasoning
    "gemma2-9b-it",         # Instruction-tuned
]
```

### 📊 **3. Improve Answer Relevancy**

#### A. Question Analysis
```python
def analyze_question(question):
    """Analyze question type and required information"""
    question_types = {
        "what": "definition/explanation",
        "how": "process/method", 
        "why": "reason/cause",
        "when": "time/date",
        "where": "location",
        "who": "person/entity"
    }
    # Adapt retrieval and generation based on question type
```

#### B. Context Reranking
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# Add reranking after retrieval
reranker = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')

def rerank_contexts(question, contexts, top_k=5):
    pairs = [[question, ctx] for ctx in contexts]
    scores = reranker.predict(pairs)
    sorted_contexts = [ctx for _, ctx in sorted(zip(scores, contexts), reverse=True)]
    return sorted_contexts[:top_k]
```

### 🛠 **4. Data Quality Improvements**

#### A. Evaluate Your Source Data
```python
def check_data_quality():
    # Check for:
    # 1. Are contexts relevant to questions?
    # 2. Are ground truth answers in the contexts?
    # 3. Are questions clear and specific?
    # 4. Is there enough context for each question?
    pass
```

#### B. Improve Ground Truth Answers
- Ensure ground truth answers are factual and complete
- Make sure they can be derived from the provided contexts
- Check for consistency across similar questions

### 🔧 **5. Technical Fixes**

#### A. Handle NaN Values
```python
# Add error handling for failed evaluations
def safe_evaluate(dataset, metrics):
    try:
        result = evaluate(dataset, metrics=metrics)
        # Check for and handle NaN values
        df = result.to_pandas()
        for col in ['context_precision', 'context_recall', 'faithfulness', 'answer_relevancy']:
            if col in df.columns:
                nan_count = df[col].isna().sum()
                if nan_count > 0:
                    print(f"⚠️  {nan_count} NaN values in {col}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Evaluation failed: {e}")
        return None
```

#### B. Increase Sample Diversity
```python
# Test with more diverse examples
def create_diverse_test_set():
    # Include different question types
    # Include easy, medium, hard questions  
    # Include questions requiring single vs multiple contexts
    # Include questions with clear vs ambiguous answers
    pass
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. ✅ **Fix NaN issues**: Debug why evaluations are failing
2. ✅ **Increase retrieval candidates**: Change `k` from 5 to 8-10
3. ✅ **Improve prompt**: Add faithfulness constraints
4. ✅ **Test with fewer samples**: Debug on 1-2 samples first

### Phase 2: Core Improvements (3-5 days)  
1. ✅ **Try better embedding model**: Test `all-mpnet-base-v2`
2. ✅ **Add reranking**: Implement context reranking
3. ✅ **Optimize chunking**: Reduce chunk size, increase overlap
4. ✅ **Review ground truth**: Ensure quality of evaluation data

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (1-2 weeks)
1. ✅ **Hybrid retrieval**: Combine dense + sparse retrieval
2. ✅ **Query expansion**: Expand questions for better retrieval
3. ✅ **Multi-step RAG**: Break complex questions into steps
4. ✅ **Custom evaluation**: Add domain-specific metrics

## Expected Score Targets

After improvements, aim for these scores:

```
🎯 Target Scores:
   context_precision: >0.80 (currently NaN/0.00)
   context_recall: >0.80 (currently 0.33 average)  
   faithfulness: >0.80 (currently 0.50)
   answer_relevancy: >0.80 (currently 0.46 average)
```

## Monitoring Progress

Track improvements with this evaluation script:

```python
def track_improvements():
    metrics_history = []
    # Run evaluation after each change
    # Compare against baseline
    # Identify which changes help most
    pass
```

Start with Phase 1 quick wins, then systematically work through Phase 2 improvements. The key is to fix one issue at a time and measure the impact.
