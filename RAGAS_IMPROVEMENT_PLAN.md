# 🎯 RAGAS Improvement Plan: Fixing ctx_relevance_ce: 0.000 and ans_groundedness_ce: 0.000

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

Your current RAGAS metrics show **zero scores** for context relevance and answer groundedness. This indicates fundamental issues in your evaluation setup that we need to fix systematically.

### Current Issues in Your QA Pairs

Looking at your `qa_pairs.jsonl`, I identified several critical problems:

#### ❌ **Problem 1: Irrelevant Negative Contexts**
```json
{
  "query": "What is personal income tax in Bangladesh?",
  "positive": "Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a direct tax...",
  "negatives": [
    "Withholding tax is applicable on services like consultancy and rent.",
    "Excise duty is imposed on bank accounts exceeding a certain threshold."
  ]
}
```

**Issue**: Your structure uses "positive" and "negatives" but RAGAS needs "contexts" (relevant documents) and "ground_truth" (correct answers). The "negatives" are irrelevant to the question.

#### ❌ **Problem 2: Generic, Vague Answers**
All your answers are identical:
```text
"Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a direct tax levied on an individual's annual income. The tax rates are progressive and determined by the National Board of Revenue (NBR), with tax-free thresholds and specific slabs based on income brackets."
```

**Issue**: This generic answer doesn't specifically address different questions like "How to calculate tax?" vs "What are tax brackets?"

#### ❌ **Problem 3: Missing Ground Truth**
Your data lacks proper ground truth answers that RAGAS can compare against to measure accuracy and relevance.

## 🛠 **Solution: Systematic Improvements**

### Step 1: Fix Data Structure

**Before (Current):**
```json
{
  "query": "What is personal income tax in Bangladesh?",
  "positive": "Generic answer...",
  "negatives": ["Irrelevant context 1", "Irrelevant context 2"]
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "query": "What is personal income tax in Bangladesh?",
  "contexts": [
    "Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a direct tax levied on individual annual income. Tax rates are progressive, ranging from 0% for income below BDT 3,00,000 to 25% for income above BDT 30,00,000. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) administers the tax system with specific exemptions for senior citizens and women taxpayers."
  ],
  "answer": "Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a progressive direct tax on individual annual income, administered by NBR with rates from 0% to 25% based on income brackets.",
  "ground_truth": "Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a direct tax on individual income with progressive rates administered by NBR."
}
```

### Step 2: Create Question-Specific Contexts

Each question needs **relevant, specific contexts** that actually contain the information needed to answer that question.

#### ✅ **Example: Specific Tax Brackets Question**
```json
{
  "query": "What are the income tax brackets for individuals in Bangladesh?",
  "contexts": [
    "Income tax brackets in Bangladesh for individual taxpayers: 0% on income up to BDT 3,00,000; 5% on next BDT 4,00,000; 10% on next BDT 5,00,000; 15% on next BDT 6,00,000; 20% on next BDT 12,00,000; 25% on income above BDT 30,00,000. Women and senior citizens (65+) get higher tax-free thresholds."
  ],
  "answer": "Bangladesh individual tax brackets are: 0% up to BDT 3,00,000; 5% on next 4,00,000; 10% on next 5,00,000; 15% on next 6,00,000; 20% on next 12,00,000; 25% above 30,00,000. Higher thresholds apply for women and seniors.",
  "ground_truth": "Tax brackets range from 0% to 25% with progressive rates and higher thresholds for women and senior citizens."
}
```

#### ✅ **Example: Calculation Process Question**
```json
{
  "query": "How to calculate personal income tax in Bangladesh?",
  "contexts": [
    "To calculate personal income tax: 1) Add all income sources (salary, business, rent, etc.), 2) Subtract allowable deductions (investment up to 25% of income or BDT 15,00,000, donations, insurance), 3) Apply tax rates progressively on net income, 4) Add 10% surcharge if income exceeds BDT 50,00,000, 5) Deduct advance tax paid and TDS to find net tax payable."
  ],
  "answer": "Calculate personal tax by: adding all income sources, subtracting allowable deductions (investment up to 25% or BDT 15,00,000, donations, insurance), applying progressive rates, adding surcharge on high income, then deducting advance payments.",
  "ground_truth": "Calculation involves total income minus deductions, progressive rate application, surcharge if applicable, minus advance payments."
}
```

### Step 3: Improve Context Relevance

#### **Context Relevance Checklist:**
1. ✅ **Direct Relevance**: Context directly answers the question
2. ✅ **Specific Information**: Contains specific details, not generic statements
3. ✅ **Complete Coverage**: Provides enough information for a complete answer
4. ✅ **Accurate Facts**: All information is factually correct
5. ✅ **Proper Scope**: Neither too broad nor too narrow for the question

### Step 4: Enhance Answer Groundedness

#### **Answer Groundedness Checklist:**
1. ✅ **Factual Accuracy**: Every claim in the answer is supported by context
2. ✅ **No Hallucination**: No information added beyond what's in the context
3. ✅ **Direct Citation**: Answer directly references context information
4. ✅ **Complete Coverage**: Answer addresses all parts of the question using context
5. ✅ **Proper Attribution**: Claims are attributable to the provided context

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

### Immediate Actions (Today):

1. **Replace Your Current QA File**
   ```bash
   # Use the improved QA pairs I created
   cp data/improved_qa_pairs.jsonl data/qa_pairs_backup.jsonl
   cp data/improved_qa_pairs.jsonl data/qa_pairs.jsonl
   ```

2. **Run Improved Evaluation**
   ```bash
   python improved_ragas_evaluation.py
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Check if context_precision > 0.6
   - Verify faithfulness > 0.7
   - Ensure answer_relevancy > 0.7

### Advanced Improvements (Next Steps):

1. **Enhance Retrieval System**
   ```python
   # Use better embedding model
   EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
   
   # Improve retrieval parameters
   retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
       search_type="mmr",  # Maximum Marginal Relevance
       search_kwargs={
           "k": 8,           # More candidates
           "fetch_k": 16,    # Fetch more before selection
           "lambda_mult": 0.7  # Balance relevance vs diversity
       }
   )
   ```

2. **Add Context Re-ranking**
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
   
   reranker = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')
   
   def rerank_contexts(question, contexts, top_k=5):
       pairs = [[question, ctx] for ctx in contexts]
       scores = reranker.predict(pairs)
       return [ctx for _, ctx in sorted(zip(scores, contexts), reverse=True)][:top_k]
   ```

3. **Improve Answer Generation Prompt**
   ```python
   IMPROVED_PROMPT = """
   You are a financial expert assistant. Answer the question based STRICTLY on the provided context.
   
   RULES:
   1. Use ONLY information from the provided context
   2. If context lacks information, say "The provided context doesn't contain sufficient information"
   3. Quote relevant parts when possible
   4. Be specific and detailed in your answers
   5. Do not add general knowledge beyond the context
   
   Context:
   {context}
   
   Question: {question}
   
   Answer based strictly on the context:
   """
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Improvements**
