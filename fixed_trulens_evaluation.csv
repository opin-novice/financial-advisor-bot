1,general,What is personal income tax in Bangladesh?,"In Bangladesh, personal income tax refers to the tax levied on an individual's income, wealth, and economic activities. It is a crucial source of government revenue, which is used to fund public services, infrastructure development, and social welfare programs.

In Bangladesh, personal income tax is taxed on a progressive scale, meaning that higher-income individuals are taxed at a higher rate. The tax rates vary depending on the individual's income level, with a basic exemption of Tk 300,000 (for men under 65 years of age) and Tk 350,000 (for women and men above 65 years of age).

Individuals are considered resident for tax purposes if they are present in Bangladesh for more than 182 days in the income year, or if they have been present in Bangladesh for at least 365 days in the preceding four years and are present in Bangladesh during the income year for at least 90 days.

Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Bangladesh-source income. There are various exemptions and deductions available for individuals, such as exemptions for income from export business, income from agricultural activities, and income from certain industries.

To file personal income tax returns, individuals must submit a tax return form (IT-11E) to the National Board of Revenue (NBR) by the specified deadline. The NBR provides various resources and links to help individuals understand and comply with personal income tax laws and regulations.
