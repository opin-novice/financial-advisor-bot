## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Configuration Parameters (M1 Optimized)

```python
# Memory Optimization (8GB RAM)
MAX_DOCS_FOR_RETRIEVAL = 8      # Reduced from 12
MAX_DOCS_FOR_CONTEXT = 4        # Reduced from 5
CONTEXT_CHUNK_SIZE = 1200       # Reduced from 1500

# Model Configuration (Faster, Smaller Models)
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-2-v1"

# Performance Settings
BATCH_SIZE_EMBEDDING = 16       # Optimized for M1

```

### Environment Variables (Auto-configured)
```bash
TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
MKL_NUM_THREADS=4
VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=4
PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0
PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
```

## üîç Enhanced Features

### 1. Multi-Stage Query Refinement
```python
# Example: Original query gets refined through multiple stages
original_query = "How to open bank account?"

refined_queries = [
    "How to open bank account?",  # Original
    "How to open bank account bangladesh banking services deposit",  # Domain expansion
    "What are the requirements and procedures for opening a bank account in Bangladesh?",  # LLM refinement
    "How to open banking account financial institution"  # Synonym expansion
]
```

### 2. Advanced Relevance Checking
The system uses multiple factors to assess relevance:
- **LLM Semantic Analysis**: Deep understanding of query-document relationship
- **Keyword Overlap**: TF-IDF-like scoring with domain-specific terms
- **Document Quality**: Filters out form fields and low-quality content
- **Category-Specific Relevance**: Domain-aware relevance assessment

### 3. Enhanced Answer Validation
Multi-factor validation ensures answer quality:
- **LLM Validation**: Semantic correctness assessment
- **Factual Consistency**: Checks if answer facts match retrieved contexts
- **Query-Answer Alignment**: Ensures answer addresses the query intent
- **Completeness Assessment**: Evaluates answer thoroughness

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
# Start performance monitoring
from monitor_performance import start_performance_monitoring, print_performance_status

start_performance_monitoring()
print_performance_status()
```

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- Memory usage (GB and percentage)
- CPU utilization
- Query response times
- Cache hit rates
- Document processing counts
- Relevance scores
- Device utilization (MPS/CPU)

### Optimization Recommendations
The system provides automatic recommendations:
- Memory usage optimization
- CPU performance tuning
- Query speed improvements
- Cache configuration
- Device utilization

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from optimized_main import OptimizedFinancialAdvisorBot

# Initialize the bot
bot = OptimizedFinancialAdvisorBot()

# Process a query
response = bot.process_query("What are the requirements for a car loan in Bangladesh?")
print(response["response"])
```

### With Performance Monitoring
```python
import time
from monitor_performance import record_query_metrics

start_time = time.time()
response = bot.process_query("How to open a savings account?")
response_time = time.time() - start_time

# Record performance metrics
record_query_metrics(
    response_time=response_time,
    relevance_score=response.get("relevance_score", 0),
    docs_processed=len(response.get("sources", [])),
    cache_hit=False
)
```

### Telegram Bot Usage
```bash
# Run the optimized Telegram bot
python run_optimized.py

# Or run directly
python optimized_main.py
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. MPS Not Available
```bash
# Check MPS availability
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"

# If False, ensure you have:
# - macOS 12.3+ 
# - PyTorch 1.12+
# - Apple Silicon Mac
```

#### 2. High Memory Usage
```python
# Monitor memory usage
from monitor_performance import print_performance_status
print_performance_status()

# Reduce memory usage by adjusting:
MAX_DOCS_FOR_RETRIEVAL = 6  # Reduce from 8
CONTEXT_CHUNK_SIZE = 1000   # Reduce from 1200
```

#### 3. Slow Query Performance
```python
# Check performance bottlenecks
from monitor_performance import export_performance_report
export_performance_report()

# Optimize by:
# - Enabling more aggressive caching
# - Using smaller embedding models
# - Reducing context size
```

### Performance Tuning

#### For Better Speed
```python
# Use faster, smaller models
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"  # Fastest
CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2"  # Smallest

# Reduce processing
MAX_DOCS_FOR_RETRIEVAL = 6
MAX_DOCS_FOR_CONTEXT = 3
```

#### For Better Quality
```python
# Use larger, more accurate models (if memory allows)
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  # More accurate
CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2"  # Better ranking

# Increase processing
MAX_DOCS_FOR_RETRIEVAL = 10
MAX_DOCS_FOR_CONTEXT = 5
```
