# 🤖 What is this Project?

## In Simple Terms

This is an **AI-powered document assistant** that can:

1. **Read your documents** (PDFs, text files)
2. **Answer questions** about those documents
3. **Speak two languages** - English and Bangla
4. **Chat with users** through Telegram
5. **Get smarter** by improving its answers over time

## Real-World Example

Imagine you have a bank with hundreds of policy documents. Customers call asking:

- "What do I need to open a savings account?"
- "সঞ্চয় হিসাব খুলতে কি লাগে?" (same question in Bangla)

Instead of human agents searching through documents, this AI system:

1. **Understands** the question (in any language)
2. **Searches** through all your documents instantly
3. **Finds** the most relevant information
4. **Answers** in the same language the customer used
5. **Shows** which documents it used for the answer
