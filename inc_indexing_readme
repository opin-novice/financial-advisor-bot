# SentenceTransformer based on BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

### Model Description

- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 512 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 768 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

### Model Sources

- **Documentation:** [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://sbert.net)
- **Repository:** [Sentence Transformers on GitHub](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)

```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'Do I need to pay advance tax as an individual in Bangladesh?',
    "Personal income tax in Bangladesh is a direct tax levied on an individual's annual income. The tax rates are progressive and determined by the National Board of Revenue (NBR), with tax-free thresholds and specific slabs based on income brackets.",
    'Corporate tax rates in Bangladesh vary depending on company type and sector.',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 768]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[ 1.0000, -0.7333,  0.9558],
#         [-0.7333,  1.0000, -0.7096],
#         [ 0.9558, -0.7096,  1.0000]])
