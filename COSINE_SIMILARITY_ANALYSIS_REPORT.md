# Cosine Similarity and Embedding Model Compatibility Analysis Report

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED: Embedding Model Mismatch

### 📊 Executive Summary

**Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL COMPATIBILITY ISSUE**

Your project **does show cosine similarity scores** for retrieved chunks, but there's a **critical mismatch** between the embedding models used for document indexing and query processing.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. **Cosine Similarity Scores Are Displayed** ✅

**Yes, your project shows cosine similarity scores in multiple places:**

1. **FAISS Retrieval**: Shows distance scores (converted to similarity)
2. **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**: Shows relevance scores with threshold checking
3. **Pipeline Logging**: Displays document relevance scores during processing

**Example from your system:**
```
📊 Cross-Encoder Relevance Scores from Actual Pipeline:
   Document 1: 7.146 (🟢 Highly Relevant)
   Document 2: 6.418 (🟢 Highly Relevant)
   Document 3: 6.322 (🟢 Highly Relevant)
   Document 4: 5.390 (🟢 Highly Relevant)
   Document 5: 4.339 (🟡 Relevant)
```

### 2. **Embedding Model Mismatch** ❌

**CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

| Component | Embedding Model | Location |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Document Indexing** | `BAAI/bge-m3` | `docadd.py` |
| **Query Processing** | `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` | `config.py` |

**Result**: ❌ **INCOMPATIBLE MODELS**

## 📈 Similarity Score Analysis

### FAISS Cosine Similarity Scores (Current State)

#### Query: "How to open a bank account in Bangladesh?"

```

#### Query: "What are the loan eligibility criteria?"
```
Document 1: Distance: 0.5820 | Similarity: 0.4180 (🟠 Fair)
Document 2: Distance: 0.7117 | Similarity: 0.2883 (🔴 Poor)
Document 3: Distance: 0.7627 | Similarity: 0.2373 (🔴 Poor)
Document 4: Distance: 0.7657 | Similarity: 0.2343 (🔴 Poor)
Document 5: Distance: 0.8121 | Similarity: 0.1879 (🔴 Poor)
```

#### Query: "Tax calculation methods for individuals"
```
Document 1: Distance: 0.8663 | Similarity: 0.1337 (🔴 Poor)
Document 2: Distance: 0.8726 | Similarity: 0.1274 (🔴 Poor)
Document 3: Distance: 0.9033 | Similarity: 0.0967 (🔴 Poor)
Document 4: Distance: 0.9139 | Similarity: 0.0861 (🔴 Poor)
Document 5: Distance: 0.9344 | Similarity: 0.0656 (🔴 Poor)
```

### Cross-Encoder Relevance Scores (Working Correctly)

The Cross-Encoder re-ranking is working well and compensating for the embedding mismatch:

```
Query: "How to open a bank account in Bangladesh?"
Document 1: 9.4496 (🟢 Highly Relevant) - Above threshold (0.2)
Document 2: -5.0089 (🔴 Not Relevant) - Below threshold
Document 3: -7.9084 (🔴 Not Relevant) - Below threshold
Document 4: -11.0179 (🔴 Not Relevant) - Below threshold
```

## 🔧 Impact Analysis

### ❌ Problems Caused by Model Mismatch

1. **Inaccurate Cosine Similarity**: Scores don't reflect true semantic similarity
2. **Poor Initial Retrieval**: FAISS may miss relevant documents
3. **Inconsistent Rankings**: Document order may not reflect actual relevance
4. **Reduced System Performance**: Overall retrieval quality is compromised

### ✅ Mitigating Factors

1. **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**: Helps correct poor initial retrieval
2. **Advanced RAG Feedback Loop**: Provides multiple refinement attempts
3. **Relevance Threshold Filtering**: Removes obviously irrelevant documents

## 📊 Score Quality Assessment

### Current FAISS Similarity Scores
- **Best scores**: ~0.53-0.67 (Fair to Good range)
- **Average scores**: ~0.20-0.40 (Poor to Fair range)
- **Worst scores**: ~0.06-0.13 (Very Poor range)

### Expected Scores with Compatible Models
- **Best scores**: Should be ~0.80-0.95 (Excellent range)
- **Average scores**: Should be ~0.60-0.80 (Good range)
- **Worst scores**: Should be ~0.30-0.50 (Fair range)

## 🛠️ Solutions

### Option 1: Re-index Documents (Recommended)
```bash
# Update docadd.py to use the same model as queries
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
```

**Steps:**
1. Modify `docadd.py` line 18
2. Delete existing `faiss_index/` directory
3. Re-run document indexing process
4. Test retrieval quality

### Option 2: Change Query Model
```python
# Update config.py to match document model
self.EMBEDDING_MODEL = "BAAI/bge-m3"
```

**Steps:**
1. Modify `config.py` line 15
2. Restart the application
3. Test retrieval quality

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Advanced)
- Keep both models
- Use document model for initial retrieval
- Use query model for query refinement
- Implement model-specific similarity normalization

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Fix the embedding model mismatch** (Critical Priority)
2. **Re-index documents** with the same model used for queries
3. **Test retrieval quality** after fixing

### Recommended Configuration
```python
# Both docadd.py and config.py should use:
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
```

**Reasons:**
- Well-established model with good performance
- Already configured in your query processing
- Good multilingual support
- Balanced performance vs. speed

### Quality Monitoring
After fixing, you should see:
- **FAISS similarity scores** improve to 0.6-0.9 range
- **Better initial retrieval** quality
- **More consistent rankings**
- **Improved overall system performance**

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### Before Fix (Current State)
```
Query: "Bank account opening"
Top Document Similarity: 0.5353 (Fair)
Average Similarity: 0.4847 (Fair)
```

### After Fix (Expected)
```
Query: "Bank account opening"
Top Document Similarity: 0.8500+ (Excellent)
Average Similarity: 0.7200+ (Good)
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Cosine Similarity Scores

Your system currently displays similarity scores in these locations:

1. **FAISS Retrieval Logs**:
   ```
   Distance: 0.4647 | Similarity: 0.5353
   ```

2. **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**:
   ```
   Document relevance score: 7.146
   ```

3. **Pipeline Processing**:
   ```
   [INFO] ✅ Document relevance score: 6.418
   ```

## ✅ Conclusion

**Your project DOES show cosine similarity scores**, but the **embedding model mismatch is critically impacting their accuracy and usefulness**.

**Action Required:**
1. ✅ Cosine similarity display: Working correctly
2. ❌ Embedding model compatibility: **MUST BE FIXED**
3. ✅ Cross-encoder re-ranking: Working as mitigation
4. ✅ Score logging and display: Comprehensive

**Priority**: Fix the embedding model mismatch immediately to restore proper cosine similarity accuracy and improve overall retrieval quality.
