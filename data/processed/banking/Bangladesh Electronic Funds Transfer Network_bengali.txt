BEFTN OVERVIEW

1. ABOUT BEFTN

The Bangladesh Electronic Funds Transfer Network (BEFTN) will operate as a processing and
delivery centre that provides the distribution and settlement of electronic credit and debit
instructions among all participating banks. This Network is operating in a real-time batch processing
mode.

All transactions received by the central system in a clearing cycle are calculated into a single
multilateral netting figure for each bank. Final settlement takes place using accounts of each bank that
are maintained with Bangladesh Bank.

Participating banks in the BEFTN system are inter-connected via communication links. This
communication network facilitates the transmission of payments information that provides faster, safer
and a more efficient means of inter-bank instruction base clearing and settlement system. BEFTN
provides a wide range of electronic products that improves payment services for the participating
banks’ customers. It lowers the operational cost, reduces risk and increases the efficiency of the overall
payment process.

2. PARTICIPANTS IN BEFTN

BEFTN is a multilateral electronic clearing system where debit and credit payment instructions are
exchanged among Scheduled Banks. The system involves transmitting, reconciling and calculating the
net position of each participant at the end of each processing cycle. The participants with this system are:

a) Originator.

b) Originating Bank (OB)

c) Bangladesh Electronic Funds Transfer Network (EFT Operator)
d) Receiving Bank (RB)

e) Receiver

a) Originator
Originator is the entity that agrees to initiate EFT entries into the network according to an
arrangement with a receiver. The originator is usually a company, bank itself, government agency or
an individual directing a transfer of funds to or from their account.

b) Originating Bank (OB)
Originating Bank is the bank which receives payment instructions from its customer (the Originator)
and forwards the Instructions to BEFTN.

c) Bangladesh Electronic Funds Transfer Network (BEFTN)

BEFTN receives entries from OBs, distributes the entries among appropriate RBs, and facilitates the
settlement functions for the participating banks.

d) Receiving Bank (RB)

Receiving Bank is the Bank where receiver maintains account with.

e) Receiver

Receiver is Person or organization receiving a Payment Instruction from the System.

Figure 1: Participants involved in an EFT transaction

Authorization
Authorization is an arrangement between the originator and the receiver to allow payments processed
through the EFT Network. It defines the purpose, terms, conditions and legal relationship between
Originator and the Receiver. Authorization is mandatory for initiating an EFT debit entry, whereas the
authorization may be in a paper form duly signed or a web version that the customer completes online.

3. EFT TRANSACTION FLOW

By an agreement originator and originating bank determine how the instruction will be delivered from
originator to the Originating bank. Originator provides fund transfer entry to the originating bank as
per agreed format with OB to pay or collect amount from a receiver's bank (other bank) account.
Originating bank transmits the entry to the BEFTN within preset time. BEFTN sort the entries by
routing number of Receiving Bank (RB) and forward the EFT entry to the appropriate receiving bank.
On settlement date/time, BEFTN calculates multilateral netting figure for each bank. Final settlement
takes place at the books of accounts of each bank that are maintained with Bangladesh Bank.

3.1 Types of EFT Entry

Originator initiates and receiver receives the EFT entries of credit or debit payment instruction on
receiver's bank account. If the receiver’s bank account is debited, then the entry is an EFT debit. If
receiver’s bank account is credited, then the entry is an EFT credit.

10 of 83

a) EFT Credits

EFT credit entries occur when the originator (client of originating bank) transfer funds from his/her
bank account into a Receiver's (client of receiving bank) bank account.

Example: A company (originator) provides instruction to its bank (originating bank) to pay monthly
salary of the employee's (receiver) bank account by means of EFT Network. Originating bank
transfers the salary amount to the receiving bank through credit payment instruction. Receiving bank
credits the salary amount into employee's account. As the amount credited to receiver's account, the
entry is an EFT credit, which is illustrated bellow.

Originating Bank Receiving Bank

নাচ TK Debit TK Credit
Receiver
Originator

Figure 2: EFT Credit Transaction Flow

Some examples of credit entries are:
¢ Inward Foreign remittances
¢ Domestic remittances
¢ Payroll private and government
¢ Dividends/Interest/Refunds of IPO
¢ Business to business payments (B2B)
¢ Government tax payments
* Government vendor payments
¢ Customer-initiated transactions

b) EFT Debits

EFT debit entries occur when the originator collects funds from Receiver's bank account into his/her
bank account.

Example: A gas transmission company (originator) provides instruction to its bank (originating
bank) to collect gas bill from the customer's (receiver) bank account by means of ETF Network.
Originating bank provides a debit payment instruction to the receiving bank to collect the gas bill from
customer's account. Receiving bank debited gas bill amount from its client’s account and send the
same to the originating bank. Originating bank credits the gas bill into the account of gas transmission
company. As the receiver’s bank account is debited, thus the entry is an EFT debit, which is

11 of 83

illustrated bellow:
Some examples of EFT debit entries are:

° Utility bill collection

¢ Equal Monthly Installments (EMI) collection
¢ Government tax collection

* Government license fees collection

¢ Insurance premium collection

° Mortgage payments collection

¢ Club/Association subscriptions collection

4. PAYMENT TYPES
The BEFTN supports a variety of payment types. An Originator shall code the entries into the
system indicating the types (debit or credit) of payment instructions including return, reverse and
reclamation entry. Each EFT instruction is identified and recognized by Standard Entry Class (SEC)
Codes (a specific three digit code), which appears in the EFT batch record format. SEC carries the
payment and payment-related information according to natures of payment instruction. Different types
of SEC are as follows:

i) Customer Initiated Entry:
Customer Initiated Entry (CIE) is a credit instruction where the consumer transfers funds into a
company’s /individual’s account for payment of funds owed to that company/individual.
Example: Utility bill payment, P2P payments

ii) Prearranged Payment and Deposit Entry (PPD):
This instruction may be both debit and credit and the receiver must be an individual.

a) Direct Deposit: Direct deposit is a PPD credit instruction that transfers funds into a
consumer’s account at the receiving bank. The funds being deposited can represent a variety of
products.

Example: payroll, remittances, interest, pension, dividends, refunds, etc.

b) Preauthorized Bill Payment: A preauthorized payment is a PPD debit instruction where a
customer authorizes a bank to debit his/her account for a regular interval. Example: Insurance

12 of 83

premium, loan installments, utility payments etc.

iii) Corporate Credit or Debit (CDD):

CCD is either a credit or a debit instruction where funds are either distributed or consolidated
between corporate or government entities. It can support a limited disclosure of information
when the funds are being transferred between organizations (i.e. sister concerns) under the same
group.

iv) Corporate Trade Exchange:

This instruction supports the transfer of funds (debit or credit) within trading partners where
payment information is sent with the funds transfer. The payment-related information is placed in
multiple addenda records in a format agreed to by the parties and BEFTN.

v) Other Instructions

Pre-notification (Pre-note): It is a non-financial entry that passed through the EFT network. Pre-
note is initiated by the Originator (or OB) to validate the receiver’s banking information before
originating the first funds transfer entry. It is the RB’s responsibility to verify the information (i.e.
Name, A/C number/type etc.) provided in the pre-note, RB needs to issue a NOC (Notification of
Change) only if the information provided in the pre-note doesn’t match with the particulars of its
client.

Notification of Change (NOC): A RB must issue a NOC to the OB informing about the
mismatch in the account details (i.e. Name, A/C number/type) provided in a Pre-note (or a live
transaction) that doesn’t match with its client’s details. OB’s responsibility is to convey the NOC
to the Originator in order to rectify the information before initiating the live entry to the
Receiver’s account.

5. SETTLEMENT AND POSTING

To complete the payment instruction, Settlement is the actual transfer of the funds between

participating banks. BEFTN Settlement happens in a Deferred-net basis.

The transactions processed by the BEFTN will affect the accounts of the concerned participating

banks maintaining accounts with BB at the end of each processing cycle. Settlement will be completed
using the following processing cycle:

Processing Cycle — Cut Offs
Item Submission Returns Settlement
Session-1 00:00-14:00 hrs As provided 10) | 14:01 hrs
Session-2 14:00-24:00 hrs BEFTN Rules 10:00 hrs Next Day

Settlement and processing sessions will be communicated to member banks by the Clearing House
(BACH) authority from time to time.

BEFTN Currencies

The currencies eligible for transaction under the BEFTN are Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), United States
Dollar (USD), United Kingdom Pound (GBP), European Union and its territories currency - Euro

13 of 83


(EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) and Canadian Dollar (CAD). Bangladesh Bank may decide to exclude any
existing currency and include any new currency for transaction under the BEFTN from time to time.

Responsibility of participants:

Originating Bank, BEFTN Operator and Receiving Bank are the main participants concerning
settlement and posting of EFT entries. Their responsibilities are as follows:

Responsibility of Originating Bank

Originating Bank and Originator (customer of originating bank) are governed by agreement between
them which must be in line with this rule. Specific procedures and timing of settlement between them
are solely at the discretion of the said agreement. Originating Bank is responsible to monitor the credit
worthiness of its customer (originator) to manage the EFT payments efficiently.

Originating Bank follows same settlement procedures for entries originated and entries received. If
the scheduled settlement date of a credit entry is not a banking day for the Originating Bank, but the
Bangladesh Bank office is open, then the settlement will occur on the scheduled date.

Responsibility of EFT Operator (BEFTN)
BEFTN is responsible to calculate net settlement figures for each participating bank and to provide
information of amounts that will be settled for each bank on each settlement date and session.
BEFTN also sends a summary statement which contains the net amount to be settled for each
participating bank.

Responsibility of Receiving Bank (RB)

Posting:

The RB is responsible for posting entries and for providing funds availability, which are
determined by the settlement date. EFT debit entries cannot be posted prior to the settlement
date. If the Receiving Bank is closed for business on the scheduled settlement date of a debit
entry, but the BEFTN is open, the Receiving Bank will be debited on the scheduled settlement
date. EFT Credits will be posted to the Receiver’s account no later than the next session’s
settlement Cutoff.

Settlement:
It has been mentioned that Settlement between the originator and the OB is governed by an
agreement. Settlement between the RB and the receiver is determined by these Rules.

If BEFTN determines that the entry cannot be settled on the effective entry date due to a stale
date, weekend, or holiday, the BEFTN authority will settle it on the next available business
day.

¢ Settlement information is produced by BEFTN as the entries are processed. This
information is accumulated based on the type of entry (debit or credit) by settlement
date. These settlement totals are reported to the participating banks after each session.

¢ BEFTN shall provide EFT settlement information in a machine-readable format to
facilitate the automation of settlement accounting.

¢ Settlement totals should be balanced daily against totals posted to the participating
bank’s customer accounts and against any rejects that may occur. Rejects and other

14 of 83

differences must be resolved immediately.

¢ EFT settlement procedures are the same for consumer and corporate transactions. In
view of the large-value payments that flow through the EFT network for corporate
customers, participating banks should have internal procedures in place to monitor
large-value settlements totals.

6. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

From beginning to end the EFT process operates through a series of legal agreements. Before any
transaction is initiated via EFT network, the originator and OB execute an agreement to originate
payments by using BEFTN. Among others, the agreement binds the two parties to abide by the
BEFTN Rules, defines the parameters of the relationship between them and identifies processing
requirements for the specific instruction(s), and establishes their liability and accountability for
procedures related to certain instruction(s).

While this BEFTN Operating Rulebook is the primary document addressing the rules and the
regulations for the activities of the EFT network, Government’s EFT transactions may be governed
by other codes of conduct but they must accommodate the major provisions laid down in these Rules.

Other laws/regulations that have a direct bearing on EFT operation are listed as under:

Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972 (Amended 2003)

The Banking Companies Act, 1991

Money Laundering Prevention (Amended) Act, 2015

Information and Communication Technology Act, 2006.

The Bankruptcy Act, 1997

The Foreign Exchange Guidelines, Volume 1 & 2.

BEFTN FILE EXCHANGE SPECIFICATIONS

The following information outlines the requirements for processing electronic transmissions,
addresses the sequence of records in a BEFTN file, and gives a descriptive overview of the various
logical records contained in a file.

SECTION 1.1 Electronic Transmission Requirements

To ensure compatibility in electronic file transmission, necessary operating details need to be
addressed between a Participating Bank and BEFTN.

SECTION 1.2 BEFTN CD/DVD Specifications

In contingency situations, data may be submitted on CD/DVD media.

SECTION 1.3 Data Specifications
All alphanumeric and alphabetic fields must be left justified and space filled. All numeric fields must
be right justified, unsigned, and zero filled. Characters used in BEFTN records are restricted to 0-9,
A-Z, a-z and space.

SECTION 1.4 Sequence of Records in BEFTN Files
Each file begins with a File Header Record. After the File Header may be any number of batches.
Each batch is identified by a Batch Header Record and contains one or more Entry Detail Records.
The number of addenda records that accompany each entry is dependent upon the Standard Entry
Class Code. At the end of each batch is a Batch Control Record. Each file is ended with a File Control
Record. The records in BEFTN files must be in the following sequence:

File Header Record
Batch #1
Company/Batch Header
Record
Entry Detail Records or Corporate Entry Detail Records
(with Addenda Records) Company/Batch
Control Record
Batch #2
Company/Batch Header

SECTION 1.5 File Structure

File Header Record
The File Header Record designates physical file characteristics and identifies the immediate origin
(or BEFTN) and destination (or BEFTN) of the entries contained within the file or within the
transmitted batched data. In addition, this record includes date, time, and file identification fields
which can be used to identify the file uniquely.

Company/Batch Header Record

The Company/Batch Header Record identifies the Originator and briefly describes the purpose of the
entry. For example, “GAS BILL” or “SALARY” indicates the reason for the transaction originated
by the Originator. The Company/Batch Header Record contains the Routing Number of the OB for
settlement, routing of returns, and other control purposes. In addition, the Company/Batch Header
Record can indicate the intended effective entry date of all transactions within the batch. The
information contained in the Company/Batch Header Record applies uniformly to all subsequent
Entry Detail Records in the batch.

Entry Detail Record, Corporate Entry Detail Record

Entry Detail Records contain that information sufficient to relate the entry to the Receiver, 1.9.
individual bank account number, identification number, name, and the debit or credit amount as
indicated by the Transaction Code.

The information in the Company/Batch Header Record must be incorporated with the Entry Detail
Records to describe fully that entry and all participants in the transaction. The information in the
Company/Batch Header Record identifies the Originator; the Trace Number identifies the OB; bank
account information identifies both the RB and the specific account. In addition to the basic entry
format, Transaction Codes for Entry Detail Records have been defined to accommodate zero Taka
entries, and return entries. Zero entries are identical to the basic entry format but contain appropriate
Transaction Codes and zeros in the Amount field. Zero entries can be batched with other entries or
batched separately. A zero entry must be accompanied by at least one Addenda Record.

Return entries are distinguished by special Transaction Codes and must be batched separately from
other Taka entries.

Addenda Record

Addenda records will be used by the Originator to supply additional information about Entry Detail
Records that will be passed from the OB through the BEFTN to the RB. Addenda records associated
with the original Entry Detail Record or Corporate Entry Detail Record will not be included with any
Entry Detail Record being returned. Only BEFTN sanctioned specification will be permitted, as
specified by the Addenda Type Code. Addenda record information may only be used for the purpose
of transmitting payment related information. Any other use is prohibited. Each instruction and its
corresponding number of addenda records are listed below:

INSTRUCTION MAX - ADDENDA Mandatory/Optional
CCD 1 Optional

CIE 1 Optional

NOC 1 Mandatory

49 of 83

CTX 9,999 Optional

PPD 1 Optional

RETURNS 1 Mandatory
Company/Batch

Company/Batch Control Record

The Company/Batch Control Record contains the counts, hash totals, and total Taka controls
for the preceding detail entries within the indicated batch.

All Entry Detail Records are hashed. Both Entry Detail Records and Addenda Records are
included in the entry/addenda counts; Batch Header and Batch Control Records are not

included.

File Control Record

The File Control Record contains amount, entry, and hash total accumulations from the
Company/Batch Control Records in the file. This record also contains counts of the number
of blocks and the number of batches within the file (or batched data transmitted to a single

destination).

Banks must always prepare files so that individual Entry Detail Records within individual batches are
in ascending Trace Number order (although Trace Numbers need not necessarily be consecutive).
The Trace Number in an Addenda Record is the same as that of the Entry Detail Record with which

the Addenda Record is associated.

Addenda Records must be in consecutive ascending order by the Addenda Sequence Number.

SECTION 2.2 Glossary of File Format Data Elements

Field Inclusion Requirements
The following information defines the need for inclusion of certain data fields in BEFTN entries. This
involves the standardization of three definitions: Mandatory, Required, and Optional.

Mandatory for BEFTN Processing: A “Mandatory” field is necessary to ensure the proper
routing and/or posting of a BEFTN entry. Any “Mandatory” field not included in a BEFTN record
will cause that entry, batch, or file to be rejected by the BEFTN. A rejected entry will be returned to
the OB by the BEFTN. A rejected batch or rejected file will be reported to the OB or by the BEFTN.

Required: The omission of a “Required” field will not cause an entry reject at the BEFTN, but may
cause a reject at the RB. An example is the BANK Account Number field in the Entry Detail Record.
If this field is omitted by an OB, the RB may return the entry as unable to be posted. Data classified
as “Required” should be included by the Originator and OB to avoid processing and control problems
at the RB.

Optional: The inclusion or omission of an “Optional” data field is at the discretion of the Originator
and OB. However, if a BANK does originate files using optional data fields, these fields must be
returned to the OB if the entry is returned.

SPECIFICATION FOR DATA ACCEPTANCE

The data acceptance criteria set forth below applies to entries submitted by a participating bank.
Failure to meet such criteria will result in the rejection of an entire file, batch, or an individual entry by
the BEFTN. A must select either the file level reject option or the batch level reject option and notify
the BEFTN of its choice.

SECTION 3.1 File Acknowledgment
The BEFTN generates an acknowledgment for every file submitted for processing. The
acknowledgment is in the form of a message or report transmitted or made available electronically.
The BEFTN makes the acknowledgment available as soon as possible after the completion of the
edits listed in sections 3.4 (Automatic File Rejection), 3.5 (Automatic Batch Rejection), and 3.6
(Automatic Entry Detail Return Entry) of this Appendix Three. At a minimum, the acknowledgment
includes information from the following fields within the File Header and File Control Records:

e Immediate Origin

e Immediate Origin Name (if available)
e File Creation Date

e File Creation Time (if available)

e File ID Modifier

e File Entry/Addenda Count

e Total Debit Entry Amount in File

e Total Credit Entry Amount in File

e File Batch Count

The acknowledgment also contains the date and time the file was processed by the BEFTN system and,
if the file was rejected, the reason for the rejection. If the file was not rejected, but one or more
batches were rejected by the BEFTN, the acknowledgment will also contain the following
information about each rejected batch:

e Originating Bank Identification

e Originating Bank Name (if available)
e Company Name

e Company Identification

e ~=Batch Number

e Effective Entry Date

e Batch Entry/Addenda Count

e =Total Debit Amount

e =Total Credit Amount

e Reason for Batch Rejection

68 of 83

SECTION 3.2 File Level Reject Option
If the bank chooses the file level reject option, any condition which would cause a batch to be rejected
will cause the entire file to be rejected. Automatic file rejections, as described in section 3.4
(Automatic File Rejection) of this Appendix Three, are not affected by this option.

SECTION 3.3 Batch Level Reject Option
If the bank chooses the batch level reject option, any condition that would cause only a batch to be
rejected will allow the BEFTN to accept the file but to reject the erroneous batch as described in
section 3.5 (Automatic Batch Rejection) of this Appendix Three.

SECTION 3.4 Automatic File Rejections
The following error conditions will always cause the entire file to be rejected:

e The file cannot be successfully read, e.g., data read failures,
hardware/software error checks indicated.

e The file contains any “undefined” record type.

e The File Header Record does not contain the number of a valid (a point
defined on the BEFTN routing table file).

e The file is “out-of-balance,” i.e., one or more of the following
conditions exist:

e The summation of the counts, hash totals, and total amount on
Company/Batch Control

¢ Records do not agree with the File Control Record.

e The actual number of blocks or batches in the file does not agree with
the File Control Record counts.

e Mandatory fields in the File Header Record are not valid:

e File ID Modifier is upper or lower case A-Z or 0-9.

e Format Code is not 1.

e The sequence of records in the file is incorrect.

e The Immediate Origin, File Creation Date, File Creation Time, and File
ID Modifier are equal to that of a previously accepted file.

SECTION 3.5 Automatic Batch Rejection

The following error conditions will cause the batch to be rejected if batch level rejection has been
specified, or will cause the entire file to be rejected if file level rejection has been specified:
e The batch contains invalid characters (i.e., characters not specified in Appendix One, BEFTN
File Exchange Specifications).
e Except for files coming from another EFT Operator, the OB Identification in the
¢ Company/Batch Header Record is not the routing number of a valid OB.
e The Service Class Code in a Company/Batch Header Record is other than a currently valid
code.
e The Trace Numbers on the file are not in ascending sequence within a batch.
e The Transaction Codes in Entry Detail Records are invalid.
e The Amount field in an Entry Detail Record is non-numeric.
e The sequence of records in the batch is incorrect.
e The batch is “out-of-balance,” i.e., the counts, hash totals, or Takas in the Company/Batch
¢ Control Records do not agree with the summation of the entries for the batch.

The Company Name is all spaces or all zeros.

The Company Entry Description is all spaces or all zeros.

The Company Identification is all spaces or all zeros.

The Standard Entry Class Code in the Company/Batch Header Record is other than a currently

Company/Batch Header Record. Either a debit Transaction Code is in a credit batch, or a credit

Transaction Code is in a debit batch.

The Transaction Code in an Entry Detail Record is not valid for the Standard Entry Class Code
in the Company/Batch Header Record. For Standard Entry Class Code NOC or RET, the
Transaction Code must be 21, 26, 31, or 36.

Return and non-return transactions are in the same batch.

Return, dishonoured return, and/or contested dishonoured return transactions are in the same
batch.

The Batch Number in the Company/Batch Header Record is non-numeric.

MINIMUM DESCRIPTION STANDARDS

These rules require each RB to send or make available to each Receiver specific minimum descriptive
information concerning each credit or debit entry to the Receiver’s account. This descriptive
information is as follows:

(a) Posting date to customer’s account

(b) Amount of the entry

(c) Company name

(d) Company entry description

(e) Type of account (e.g., checking)

(f) Number of the account

(g) Amount of any charges assessed against the account for electronic funds transfer services

(h) Balances in the customer’s account at the beginning and at the close of the statement

(i) Address and telephone number to be used for inquiries or notices of errors preceded by “Direct
Inquiries To” or similar language

(j) Company Descriptive Date

(k) Individual Identification Number/ Identification Number

Terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in Appendix Two (BEFTN message
Specifications) of these Rules.

71 of 83

RETURN ENTRIES

Except as otherwise provided in Article Five, section 5.1 (Return of Entries) of these Rules, a RB may
return entries for any reason, provided it uses an appropriate Return Reason Code as specified in
this Appendix. If no appropriate Return Reason Code is specified in this Appendix Five, the RB shall
use the code which most closely approximates the reason for return.

SECTION 5.1 Automated Return Entries
NOTE: Throughout this section, banks will always be designated by their original names. For
example, the OB is the bank that initially prepared the original entry, and which will eventually have
the Automated Return Entry delivered to it. The RB is the bank that was supposed to receive the
original entry and will usually be preparing the Automated Return Entry.

When an Automated Return Entry is prepared, the original Company/Batch Header Record, the
original Entry Detail Record, and the Company/Batch Control Record are copied for return to the
Originator. The SEC code will be as per inward SEC Code.

The Automated Return Entry is looked at as a new entry, generated because the original entry failed to
accomplish its intended purpose. Thus, these entries should be assigned new batch and trace
numbers, new identification numbers for the returning institution, appropriate transaction codes, and
so on.

The File Creation Date is of use to the OB when the entry is being returned by the BEFTN. Otherwise,
this data element is for a file created outside the organization of the OB and the information is not
helpful. The OB can determine if the date is from its own file by looking at Field 12 of the
Company/Batch Header Record, which now carries the identification of the institution preparing the
return entry.

There is nothing required in the format that limits the number of Entry Detail Record/Addenda
Record pairs to one for each batch. Multiple entry return entry batches certainly may be generated
from one original batch.

SECTION 5.2 Table of Return Reason Codes

Codes To Be Used by the RB for Return Entries

ROI! | - [Insufficient Funds
|The available and/or cash reserve balance is not sufficient to cover the amount of the debi
entry.

RO2 | - |Account Closed
