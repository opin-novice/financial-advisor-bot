Lending Rates Behavior in Bangladesh: Some Facts and
Determinants

I. Background of the study:

Bangladesh Bank has been practicing monetary targeting policy
framework since 1972 after independence under different exchange rates
regimes. Prior to 1990, the policy was based on direct control of various
instruments, such as volume and direction of credit and interest rates. After the
adoption of Financial Sector Reform Program in 1990, the policy stance was
shifted toward indirect control. Until 1990, the deposits and lending rates were
administered and rarely adjust to inflation. However, in order to introduce
market based interest rates system, a new interest rates policies were put in
place in early 1990. Under the new policy, banks were allowed to determine

their interest rates for both deposits and lending.

Repurchase agreement (repo) and reverse repo were introduced for
banks and financial institutions as indirect monetary policy tools for day - to -
day liquidity management in response to temporary and unexpected
disturbances in the supply and demand for money in 2002 and 2003
respectively. To establish a high-tech standard transaction mechanism for
various government bills/bonds in primary and secondary markets, an on-line
system has been put in place since October 20, 2003. Recently, in order to
contain upward pressure on inflation BB raised its policy rates, i.e., repo and

reverse repo respectively to 7.25 and 5.25 percent in September, 2013.

The Chart-1 shows the trends of the weighted average deposit and lending

rates since 1990. It is observed from the Chart that both the deposits and
2

lending rates moved together and have similar co-movements. Both the rates
shared a declining trend during June 1990-June 1995 just before showing an
increasing trend in 1996. In recent years both the rates show an upward trend.
The spread between lending and deposit rates was relatively wider during the
decade of 1990s and 2000s as compared with that of the recent decade.

Charts-2 and 3 show the trends of deposit and the lending rates of all groups of
banks in Bangladesh. Chart-2 on quarterly data shows that the deposits rates of
PCBs and SPBs were much higher and have similar trends compared with the
other counterparts. The FCBs have the lowest deposits rates among the
groups. It is observed from Chart-3 that the lending rates of PCBs and FCBs
were much higher and moved in similar way throughout the period under

review. Compared with PCBs and FCBs, SCBs and SPBs lending rates were

much lower.

The scatter data plots (Chart-4) of deposit and lending rates as of March, 2014
also show similar trends. PCBs’ deposit and lending rates were much higher
among the groups and hovered around 8-12 percent and 14-16 percent
respectively. FCBs have lower deposits rates but higher lending rates. SCBs’
deposits rates lie in the range of 7.5 -10 percent while lending rates are in the
range of 9-12 percent implying that their deposit and lending rates both are
lower than those of other groups of banks. Despite the higher cost of fund
(deposit rates) the SPBs’ lending rates are relatively lower than those of PCBs’

and similar to those of FCBs.

Charts 5 and 6 show the frequency distribution of deposits and lending rates in
December, 2013. Chart-5 shows that 29 banks out of 56 banks have the
deposit rates from 8-10 percent while 13 banks have the deposit rates in the
range of 10-12 percent, 7 banks have the deposit rates from 6 - 8 percent, 5
banks have 4-6 percent. On the other hand, Chart-6 shows that 30 banks out of
56 banks have the advance rates from 14-16 percent while 14 banks fall in the
range of 12-14 percent, 6 banks have advance rates from 10-12 percent and 3

remaining banks charge 8-10 percent for their advances.

From Chart-7, it has been observed that 29 banks out of 56 have the
spread between 4-6 percent, while 23 banks have 4.5-5.5 percent, 11 banks
have spread of 2-4 percent, while 6 banks have 6-8 percent (Source: Statistics

From Table-1, it is observed that all the real deposit rates are positive with the

exception of real savings deposits rates reflecting relatively lower nominal

rates on saving deposits than those of deposits.

II. An analysis of the profitability of banks

Interest income ”

A brief overview of the interest income growth of different group of banks
shows that interest income of all groups of banks have increased from 2009 to

2011. However, the growth of interest income of all banks started to decline

2 Note: Interest Income = Interest on loans and advance + Interest on Money at call and short notice +
Interest on balance with other banks and financial institutions + Interest on balance with foreign banks
and BB F/C accounts + Other Interest income.

Interest expenses= Interest expenses on Deposit + Interest expenses on Borrowings + Interest Paid to
Foreign Bank Accounts + Other Interest Expense.

from 2011 and continued till 2013. Although SPBs/DFIs have the highest
growth of interest income followed by the PCBs, SCBs and FCBs, PCBs holds
74% share of interest income in 2013 against 69% in 2008. The FCBs interest
income share of total industry income decreased and stood at 6% in 2013,
which was 10% in 2008. Percentage share of interest income of SCBs in 2008
and 2013 were 17% and 16% respectively and DFIs have the same percentage

share of interest income of 4% in 2008 and also in 2013.

Growth of interest expenses for most of the groups of banks have increased
during 2010 to 2012 while PCBs have seen their interest expenses increase
during 2010 to 2011. From 2012 onward all the groups have witnesses
declining trends in their interest expenses. In 2013, DFIs have the highest
growth of interest expenses followed by the SCBs, PCBs, and FCBs. PCBs
hold 69% share of interest expenses of total industry in 2008 & also in 2013.
FCBs have the 4% share of interest income in 2013 which was 7% in 2008.
Percentage share of interest expenses of SCBs in 2008 and 2013 were 20%
and 22% respectively. DFIs have the 4% share of interest Expenses in 2008 &
5% in 2013.

In view of visualizing recent trends in interest rates in some selected countries,
several Charts containing real interest rates on deposits and lending rates

Lending rates are generally high in South Asian and in some of the South East
Asian countries relative to those of developed countries. As reflected in Chart
17 that the lending rates of India and Sri Lanka have decreased significantly
from the level of 2008, whereas it was relatively stagnant in Pakistan in last
five years. Remarkably, Singapore is maintaining a stable and lower lending
rate. Likewise, the representing developed countries have relatively more
stable and lower interest rates not exceeding single digit through-out the whole

period under report.

Real lending rates are adjusted for inflation measured by the GDP deflator.
From Chart-18, it can be observed that the real interest rates are comparatively
high in Bangladesh than other South Asian countries, but it has a decreasing

trend from 2009 onwards. The real interest rates are volatile in most of the

countries and some countries have even negative real interest rates in some

periods due to volatility in inflation.

like Canada or Australia have relatively lower interest rates spread.
Chart-20: Relationship between the lending rates and the deposits rates,

inflation, non-performing loans, policy rates and NSD certificates rate


From Chart 20 the relationship between the lending rates with the deposit
rates, NSD certificate rates, repo and reverse repo rates are evident. However,
the relationship between the private sector credit and NPL with the lending

rates is not very clear.

IV: Model Variables, Model Specification and Empirical Results

In order to estimate the determinants of lending rates of all scheduled banks in
total and in groups, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method is used for the
sample period from 2003:q1 to 2013:q4. The model variables are as follows:
LR=weighted average lending rates of all banks and also bank group-wise;
DR=weighted average deposit rates of all banks and bank group-wise;
INF=CPI Inflation rates (12 month average);

NPL= Non-performing loans of all banks and also bank group;

PSC= private sector credit;

NSD= national saving directorates of 3 and 5 years;

Repo and Reverse repo=policy rates of central bank.

Model Specification

lr=f (dr, inf, nl, psc, usd, polic rate)

Ir=ooir+a drt 0211177-03101)17 ayipolicy rates+asiNSD+a6i\PSC+e,

expected parameters,a0i ....c6i > 0

Data Analysis

All the variables used in the model are stationary as suggested by augmented —
Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) tests. Private sector credit are
used in the growth form while rates of inflation, non-performing loans,
lending and deposit rates, repo and reverse repo rates have been used in its

level form.

Empirical results: All Banks

The empirical results from OLS for all banks show that deposit rates, inflation,
non-performing loans and both 3 and 5 year NSD certificate rates are
statistically significant and appear with the expected positive signs, while
private sector credit and repo and reverse repo did not appear significant for
all banks. As per reported results, therefore, it can be noted that one

percentage point increase in the deposit rates will increase the lending rates by

11

0.89 percentage points for all banks, while one percentage point increase in
inflation and NSD certificates will increase lending rates by 14 and 13 basis
points respectively. The marginal impact of non-performing loans ratio on

lending rates is also positive (0.05) and significant.

The empirical results by OLS for SCBs show that deposits rates, inflation,
nonperforming loan and both 3 and 5 year NSD certificate rates are significant
and appear with the expected positive signs, while repo and reverse repo did
not appear significant. This implies that one percentage point increase in the
deposit rates will increase the lending rates by 1.35 percentage points. While
one percent increase in inflation and NSD certificates will increase lending
rates by 0.07 and 0.24 percent respectively. The impact on non-performing

Private Commercial Banks

The empirical results by OLS for PCBs show that the deposits rates, inflation,
nonperforming loan and both 3 and 5 year NSD certificate rates are significant
and appear with the expected positive signs, while repo and reverse repo did
not appear significant. The results indicate that one percentage point increase
in the deposit rates will increase lending rates by 0.85 percentage points, while
one percent increase in inflation and NSD certificates will increase lending
rates by 0.20 and 0.28 percent respectively. The impact on non-performing

loan on lending rates is 0.12.

Specialized Banks

The empirical results by OLS for SPBs show that deposits rates,

significant with the expected positive signs, while inflation, repo and reverse
repo is not significant. This means that one percentage point increase in the
deposit rates will increase lending rates by 0.63 percentage points for SPBs.
While non-performing loan and NSD certificates will increase lending rates by

0.07 and 0.17 percent respectively.

The empirical results by OLS for FCBs show that the impact of deposits rates,
inflation, repo and reverse repo rates on the lending rates are significant and
also appear with the expected positive signs, while both 3 and 5 year NSD
certificate and inflation variable is not significant. It reveals from the empirical
analysis that one percentage point increase in the deposit rates will increase
lending rates by 1.50 percentage points while one percentage point increase in
reverse repo rates will increase lending rates by 0.34 percentage points. This

implies that among the group of banks only foreign banks respond to policy

rates.

The bottom line of this analysis is that the deposits and NSD certificate rates
affect the lending rates of banks strongly. Inflation, nonperforming loans also
have impact on the lending rates with varying magnitudes among group of
banks.

An estimate of threshold level of lending rates with regard to Private
Sector Credit in Bangladesh

The threshold level of lending rates, i.e., the level of lending rates after which
the private sector credit growth of a country would be adversely affected
draws attentions of a large pool of academicians, policymakers and
researchers of both developing and developed countries due to its potentiality
to jeopardize overall progress of a country. In Bangladesh, persistently higher
lending rates concern whether this level of lending rate poses any threat to the

private sector credit growth and, hence, economic growth of Bangladesh.

In this backdrop, an attempt is made to estimate the threshold level of the
lending rates for Bangladesh. An eye ball examination using actual quarterly
data plots from 2003Q1 to 2013Q4 of private sector credit growth and the
lending rates show that the threshold level of lending rates that hurts private

sector credit of Bangladesh is around 11.65-12 percent.

An empirical investigation using OLS also suggests very similar threshold
level of lending rates (i.e., 11.65 percent) for Bangladesh. Variables used to
estimate the model are: PSC= Private sector credit and LR=lending rates.
Using empirical results obtained from OLS and _ setting first
differentiation=zero and solving the equation, we get the threshold level of
lending rates at 11.65 percent. This equation also satisfies the second order

condition (SOC) of maximization.

Spsc/Slr=(24.92/2.14)=11.65

Although further investigations are needed to come up with a concrete level of
lending rates which may not remain the same overtime as all the economic
parameters are also subject to change overtime. However, based on current
findings, we can have an idea up to what level of lending rates our private
sector credit growth remain unaffected. As we have seen from eye-ball test
(based on fitted data plot) and OLS estimation that the level of threshold
lending rates lies within the range of 11.5-12.0 percent, above which the
private sector growth of the country may be adversely affected. As the current
lending rates have a tendency to go beyond this threshold level, policy makers
may take it seriously so that the current growth momentum of Bangladesh

economy could be kept unaffected.

16

The minimum level of deposits rate that will not hurt the lending rate

LR vs. Polynomial (degree=2) of DR

From above data plot of lending and deposits rates, it has been shown that
when the deposit rate is below 5.6 percent with corresponding lending rates at
around 10.65 percent, deposit rates do not have any impact on the lending rate.
However, after that rate an increasing in the deposit rate will increase the
lending rate
Interpretations of the results
Empirical estimation and data analysis from the study show that bank deposit
rates i.e., cost of fund is one of the main determining factors that affect
lending rates of all banks in Bangladesh.
Implications of the results
> If deposit rates increased by 100 basis points, State Owned
Commercial Banks (SCBs) and Foreign Commercial Banks (FCBs)
will adjust lending rates by more than 100 basis points (by 135 basis
points and 150 basis points respectively). While for Private
Commercial Banks (FCBs) and Specialized Banks (SPBs), one 100
basis points increase in deposit rates will increase lending rates by 85
and 63 basis points respectively.
> Both 3 year and 5 year NSD certificate rates affect the lending rates for
all groups of banks except for FCBs. The lending rates will increase by
24, 28 and 17 basis points respectively for one 100 basis points
increase in the 3 year NSD certificates rates for SCBs, PCBs, and
SPBs.
17

> SCBs and PCBs lending rates adjust with inflation by 0.07 and 0. 20
percent respectively, while SPBs and FCBs do not adjust inflation with
the lending rates.

৮ Non-performing loans matters for SCBs, PCBs and SPBs except for
FCBs by 0.08, 0.12, 0.07 percent respectively.

৮ Only FCBs consider Repo and Reverse repo policy rates while
determine the lending rates.

Besides, an empirical investigation also data analysis suggest that the
threshold level of the lending rates lies within the range of 11.5-12.0 percent,
above which the private sector growth of Bangladesh may be adversely
affected.

In addition, further analysis suggests a minimum level of weighted average
deposits rate of 5.6 percent. After that level an increase in the deposit rates
will increase the lending rates.

V. Conclusions and recommendations:

The intention of this study is to analyze lending rate behavior in Bangladesh
and also to determine the factors that mostly affect the lending rates. For this
purpose, a set of macro and bank specific variables are used to examine
whether the lending rates move due to changes in these variables. The
Ordinary Least Square method (OLS) is used to determine the lending rates of
all banks, state owned banks, private commercial banks, specialized banks and
also for foreign banks. The deposits rates, inflation, non-performing loans,
repo and reverse repo, both 3 year and 5 year rates are used. The empirical

results show that the lending rates impacts vary among the different banks

groups.

The deposit rates appear to be the most significant variables for all banks and
also for bank groups in increasing the lending rates. Both the NSD certificate
rates also appear significant for all groups of banks except for foreign banks.
Inflation and non-performing loans also matters for determining the bank
lending rates. However, the deposit rates do not affect the all bank groups in
the same way. Besides, an empirical investigation using Ordinary Least
Square method (OLS) also suggests that the threshold level of the lending

rates lies within the range of 11.5-12.0 percent above which the private sector

growth of Bangladesh may be adversely affected. Therefore, as a policy

implication of this study is that the policy makers need to keep an eye on

deposit rates, inflation, NSD certificate rates and non-performing loans to keep

the lending rates within the level of 12 percent.

Recommendations

1.

It would be hard in the short run to bring down deposit rates and
lending rate without coordinated efforts among government, central
bank, non-banks financial institutions. Therefore, immediately a
committee may be formed to work together to reduce the factors
affecting lending rates.

Deposits rates of banks as well as rates offered by new banks and non-
banks financial institutions along with the NSD certificates rates may
be reduce to reduce the lending rates.

For medium and long term private sector should depend more on
capital market for financing as maturity mismatch of banks create fund
problem.

In order to bring competitiveness private sector should borrow more
from external sector for medium and long term financing at a low
interest rate.

In the medium and long term the Central Bank may think to reduce
unremunerated assets such as CRR gradually to available more funds

for bank as reserves.
