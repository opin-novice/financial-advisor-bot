1. Introduction
1.1. | Objective of the Project

COVID-19 has had major impact on the business operation and financial health of the Cottage,
Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (CMSMEs)in Bangladesh. CMSMEs are essential
for overall economic development of a country contributing around 20-25% of the GDP and are
an important source of economic growth and employment. Yet this group is hard hit by the
pandemic and often struggles to access bank loans. Based on this recognition, the Government of
Bangladesh (GOB) announced BDT200 billion incentive package for the CMSME sector where
banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) are providing working capital loans using
their own fund to CMSMEs. Necessary guidelines have been issued by Bangladesh
Bank(SMESPD Circular no. 1 dated 13 April 2020).

Bangladesh Bank (BB) further formed a revolving refinance scheme amounting BDT 100 billion
under SMESPD Circular-2 dated 26 April 2020 (Refinancing Scheme). The aim is to provide up
to 50% of refinancing loan to banks and NBFIs against their disbursed working capital loans to
CMSMEs.

Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)hasagreed to provide a loan of USD300 million to
the People’s Republic of Bangladesh(the Borrower) under its COVID-19 Recovery Facility to
support the Refinancing Schemeto the CMSME sector (the Project).Under the Project, AIIB
will lend to the government a sovereign backed loan. The Loan Agreement (L/A) for the Project
was signed between AIIB and the GOB on February 26, 2021. The funds available under the
Project would be passed on to the Participating Financial Institutions(PFIs) on a back to-back basis,
i.e., the PFIs would repay to the government on essentially the same loan at the end of 1 year
expiry of refinance.

1.2. Purpose of Operations Manual

TheOperations Manual (OM) presented here is specifically for the use of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and for the PFIs, OM is intended to facilitate PIU and PFIs to
thoroughly understand policies and the mechanism of the Project, to process the AIIB loan and to
realize successful implementation of the Project. Necessaryamendments may be made at any
timebased on the changes in economic situation or laws.

Any change in the OM, which would materially change the structure and/or nature of the
scheme, shall be made by the PIU with the approval of competent authorities as listed in Annex 1
and with concurrence of AIIB.

1) Application for Sub-loan to be prepared by the Sub-borrower

The PFI shall have the Sub-borrower prepare an application for the Sub-loan prior to proceeding
to the credit appraisal process of the bank.The PFI shall use its own format for Application of
Sub-loan. In preparing the formalities required for the Project, the PFI is guided by BB’s Small
and Medium Enterprise Credit Policies and Programmes in which it is stipulated that each
bank/financial institution shall follow a separate business strategy in financing SME loan with
least formalities in executing documentation to ensure easy and speedy loan sanction and
disbursement process. Any part of the information that is required under the Project but is not
required under the prevailing commercial practice must be provided additionally by the Sub-
borrower to PFI. The application shall contain, among others, the information required for the

20

credit appraisal and for examining the compliance of the Sub-loan with the eligibility criteria of
the Project.

Upon receipt of the Application from the Sub-borrower, the PFI assigns its own number to each
of the Sub-loan which is distinct and self-indicative as the Sub-loan under the Project. The PFI
conducts credit appraisal and verification of the compliance, based on the Application submitted
by the Sub-borrower and uses the information submitted for transcription into Form A-1,
Application for Refinancing Loan and Form A-2, Request for Disbursement of
RefinancingLoan(Annex 7) for submission and application to PIU for the disbursement of RL.

2) Credit Appraisal of Sub-loan by PFI

The PFI conducts credit appraisal and verification of the compliance with the banking and non-
bank financial institutions regulations and with the eligibility requirement established for the
Project. The credit appraisal and verification of the compliance with the banking regulations
shall be conducted based on the policy and procedural rules established by the PFI whereas the
verification of the compliance with the eligibility requirement for the Project shall be conducted
based on the Operations Manual that demonstrate the relevant terms and conditions to be
satisfied by the Sub-loan/Sub-borrower.

3) Credit Appraisal and Verification of Compliance with the Regulations

The approval process may vary among the PFIs. The typical procedures to be followed for the
credit appraisal and verification of compliance with the banking regulation, however, appear to
be as follows

e The Sub-borrower fills up the Application for Sub-loan with accurate and sufficient
information;

e The Sub-borrower shall provide CIB undertakings, the financial statements, other
information, papers and documents required by the relationship officer in charge at the
branch office;

e The relationship officer in charge at the branch shall evaluate the Sub-borrower’s
Application with due diligence, accomplish the relevant tasks and prepares the Credit
Assessment Report;

e The Credit Assessment Report shall be forwarded to zonal office or to head office for
review by the Zonal Credit Risk Officer (ZCRO) or Head Office Credit Risk Officer
(HCRO);

e ZCRO or HCRO informs the results of review to the branch office;

e ZCRO/HCRO supports the Credit Assessment and forward the recommendation for
approval to Head of Business Unit (HOBU) and to Head of Credit Risk (HOCR) for
onward recommendation;

e HOCR informs the result of review to ZCRO;

21

e HOCR and HOBU supports the Credit Assessment Report and forward the
recommendation for approval to Credit Committee;

e Credit Committee informs the decision as per the delegated authority to HOCR and
HOBU;

e Credit Committee forwards the Credit Assessment Report to Executive Committee/Board
for approval within their respective authority; and

e Executive Committee/Board informs the decision to HOCR and HOBU.

4) Verification of the Compliance with the Eligibility Requirement of the Project

The verification of the compliance with the eligibility requirement shall be the task that is unique
to the Project. The following procedures shall be adopted by the PFI to ensure the accuracy and
correctness of the information provided on the Sub-borrower and the Sub-loan submitted to PIU

A.In filling the Application for Sub-loan, the Sub-borrower shall provide information
required under the Project in addition to what are presented in the procedure described
above for credit appraisal;

B.The relationship officer in charge at the branch shall evaluate the Sub-borrower’s
Application and the information provided with due diligence, accomplish the relevant
tasks and prepares the Eligibility Assessment Report which the PFI should develop
according to its own rules and practices; and

C.The Eligibility Assessment Report thus created by the relationship officer shall
accompany the Credit Assessment Report through the layers of authority for final
approval.

5) Compliance with the Eligibility Requirement and the Operations Manual

The PFI checks and verifies the contents of the Application for Sub-loan under the Project
submitted by the Sub-borrower against the eligibility requirement and the Operations Manual.
The result of the verification shall be reflected into the preparation of Form No. A-1, Application
for Refinancing Loan. The PFI can reflect the compliance of the Sub-loan by entering the check
marks into entry boxes for compliance in the Form No. A-1, Application for Refinancing Loan.
The PFI is recommended to prepare a checklist based on which the Eligibility Assessment
Report should be created for verifying the Sub-loan’s compliance with the Eligibility
Requirement and the Operations Manual and to accompany the Credit Assessment Report to be
submitted for credit approval to the competent officer of the institution.

6) Compliance with the Banking Regulations

In conducting the credit appraisal and approval of the Application, the PFI ensures that the Sub-
loan examined is in compliance with the prevailing banking rules and regulations imposed by the
Government and/or the regulatory authority concerned. In addition, the PFI under the scheduled
banks has to comply with the Prudential Regulation for Banks of BB for all of their Sub-loans

22

under the Project. The PFI under NBFI license similarly has to comply with the Prudential
Regulation for NBFI. The procedures of the PFI established for appraising the normal credits can
be adopted for the purpose of the compliance with the Banking Regulations.

7) Collateral

A special attention is invited to the issue of collateral conditions for the Sub-loan. Under the
Project, the requirement of collateral for the Sub-loan rests upon the determination to be made by
the PFI in accordance with the PFI’s own policy and guidelines and in compliance with the rules
and regulations prevailing in Bangladesh. For consideration of the collateral issue, reference can
be made to the SME Credit Policy of BB. The BB’s policy articulates the practical approach for
dealing with the collateral requirement for SME lending. It is to be noted that the prevailing
regulation allows the PFI under the scheduled banks to render the collateral free loans up to Tk
1.0 million to small enterprises in general and to Tk 2.5 million for women entrepreneurs. The
BB’s Policy further gives the examples of tools complementing the collateral required in such
means as; personal guarantee, group guarantee, social guarantee, hypothecation of products and
machineries, group security, social security, etc.

8) Credit Approval Process

The approval process must reinforce the segregation of the Relationship Officer from the
approving authority. The relationship officer should be the owner of the customer relationship
and must be held responsible to ensure the accuracy of the entire credit application submitted for
approval. The relationship officer must be familiar with the lending guidelines of the financial
institution and should conduct due diligence on new borrowers and guarantors. The results of
credit assessment should be recommended for approval by the relationship team and forwarded
to Credit Risk Management for review and assessment. The credit should subsequently be
approved by proper approval committee.

9) Sub-loan Agreement

In addition to the normal process of credit appraisal and sanctioning of commercial loans, the
PFI confirms and endorses the compliance of the Sub-loan by examining the items falling under
the requirement for compliance mentioned above. The result of the examination shall be
described in Form A-1, Application for RL and in Form A-2, Request for Disbursement of RL.
Upon approving the Application for the Sub-loan, the PFI proceeds to the next step of
negotiating the loan contract to be mutually signed between the PFI and the Sub-borrower. The
contents of the Sub-loan Agreement shall contain those requirementsdescribed in Section 3.1.
The sequential flow of work for the credit approval and disbursement at the PFIs can be referred
toin Annex 2 — Refinance Program Work Flow Process.

10) Disbursement of Sub-loan

23

Upon signing the loan contract, the PFI makes disbursement of the Sub-loan to the account
designated by the Sub-borrower after completion of the PFI’s appraisal process and signing of
the loan contract but prior to the disbursement of RL against delivery of title document
covenanted.

6. Refinancing Loan

8. Environmental and Social
8.1. BB’s ESRM

BB has established “Guidelines on Environmental & SocialRisk Management (ESRM
Guidelines) for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh” (ESRM). AIIB has assessed the
ESRM and found it to be consistent with AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy. The ESRM
will beapplicable for this Project.

8.2. ESMS Procedures

31

Each PFI will, as a condition of eligibility for financing under the AIIB loan, be required to
adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS)in accordance with the ESRM
Guidelines ofBB.The figure below outlines the components of the ESMS that each PFI is
required to follow.

8.3. Evaluating E&S Risk of Sub-loan

The PFs will follow the provisions specified for MSMEs in the ESRM and undertake the role of
screening, selection, due diligence (DD), implementation and management of compliance of the
sub-borrowers and sub-loans.

The PFIs will carry out screening of sub-loans and assign Environmental and Social (E&S) risk
category as required in the ESRM Guidelines. Certain activities of a sub-loan are not eligible for
financing under the Project. These activities include (1) any Category A and high-risk Category
B activities in accordance with AIIB’s ESP, (2) activities listed in AIIB’s Environmental and
Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and, (3)activities listed in the Exclusion List of ESRM Guidelines
of BB.These high-risk Category B sub-loans to be excluded from the AIIB financing are those
transactions that maypotentially result in: (i) land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, (ii) risk
of adverse impacts on IndigenousPeoples and/or vulnerable groups, (iii) significant risks to or
impacts on the environment, community health andsafety, biodiversity, and cultural resources,
and/or (iv) significant occupational health and safety risks.

For SMEs involving medium risk activities as defined in the ESRM of BB and for the medium
enterprise sector, the PFI is required to carry out ES due diligence (ESDD). A time-bound ES
32

Action Plan (ESAP) will also be prepared and relevant covenants will be included in the loan
documentation. For the small enterprise sector with low ES risk activities, BB’s Exclusion List
presented in the ESRM will be applied, in addition to AIIB’s ESEL.

A team will be formed in PIU where staff from the Sustainable Finance Department (SFD) of
BB will be included to implement the ESRM Guidelines for this project through requiring
appropriate screening, approval and monitoring procedures for PFIs and sub-loans.

8.4. Monitoring E&S Risk and Reporting

Sub-borrowers should conduct self-monitoring ormonitoring by independent third parties and/or
regulatory authorities. During the monitoring process, sub-borrowers will self-report E&S
performance to respective PFI. The reporting frequency should betailored to each individual
transaction and agreed in the legal agreement.

Each PFI shall carry out monitoring of sub-borrowers’ E&S performance in accordance with the
ESRM Guidelines and PFI’s own ESMS. If non-compliance with the E&S clausesstipulated in
the legal agreement is identified, PFIstaff should follow up with the sub-borrower to resolve
these in areasonable timeframe.Depending upon the complexity of the E&S issues associated
with a sub-borrower’soperations, PFI staff should require a new corrective action plan and/or
periodic reports onE&S performance throughout the duration of the transaction. PFIs will
document their findings in the monitoring checklist as shown in Annex 11. PFIs will report to
PIU on E&S risk categorization and E&S DD at the portfolio level and submit the monitoring
checklists on a sample basis (no less than 20%) to PIU quarterly.

At PIU, staff will review and validate the monitoring checklists submitted by the PFI on a
sample basis (no less than 20%). If there is non-compliance with the E&S requirements of the
Project, PIU should follow up with the PFI who will in turn liaise with the sub-borrower to
resolve the issues in a reasonable timeframe. PIU will submit Annual Environmental and Social
Annual Report (AESR) to AIIB. The suggested outline of the AESR is presented in Annex 12.

8.5.  Project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism

A Project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism will be established at the PIU and PFI levels
based on the existing GRMs. At the PIU level, BB addresses concerns/complaints/grievances
associated with this Project through its Financial Integrity and Customer Services Department
(FICSD). FICSD is the existing grievance channel in BB which will be used in this project.
Aggrieved people can have access to the FICSD through Hotline number 16236, written
application of complain, e-mail etc. Cases are resolved within reasonable time. Communities and
individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of sub-loans may submit
complaints to the existing GRM channels in BB. In addition, SME & Special Programmes

33

Department has separate Problem Solution Center, particularly deals with complains of CMSME
entrepreneurs.

PFIs have their own GRMs in accordance with respect ESMS. The PFIs will ensure that
information about accessing available GRMs is made available to the stakeholders of the sub-
loans.

PFI will include a summary of grievance log associated with this Project in the Quarterly report
to PIU. The PIU will also report the GRM at both levels to AITB in the AESR.

8.6. Independent Accountability Mechanism (IAM)

AIIB’s Policy on the Project-Affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM) applies to this project. The
PPM has been established by AIIB to provide an opportunity for an independent and impartial
review of submissions from project-affected people who believe they have been or are likely to
be adversely affected by AIIB’s failure to implement its ESP in situations when their concerns
cannot be addressed satisfactorily through the project-level GRM or the processes of AIIB
Management. Information on AIIB’s PPM is available at: https://www.aiib.org/en/policies-
strategies/operational-policies/policyon-the-project-affected-mechanism.htm]

9. Procurement

All goods, works and services to be financed out of the proceeds of a sub-loan must be procured
in compliance with AJIB’s Procurement Policy and Interim Operational Directive on
Procurement Instructions for Recipients, as amended from time to time.

Procurement appraisal.The PFI must review the Sub-borrower’s plan for procurement of
goods, works and services to be financed out of the proceeds of each sub-loan and satisfy itself
that such plan is in compliance withestablished private sector or market practices.

10. Fund Management
10.1. Accounting Policies and Procedures

The accounting policies and procedures of the Project will be governed by the existing Project
Accounting Manual of the MOF. All project-related transactions from all sources (AIIB and
GOB) will be accounted for separately on cash basis following double-entry bookkeeping
principles.
