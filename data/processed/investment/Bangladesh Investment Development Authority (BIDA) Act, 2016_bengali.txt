Acknowledgement

We are grateful to the Ministry of Commerce for planning this study under BRCP-1 and assigning it to
The Institute for Policy, Advocacy, and Governance (IPAG) in partnership with e.Gen Consultants Ltd
for implementation. We would like to thank the Project Director, Mr. Md. Mijanur Rahman, for his
continuous support. Feedback provided by the National Trade Expert Mr. Munir Chowdhury is deeply
appreciated. This has helped us steer the report in the right direction, ensuring that the scope of the
research is aligned with tackling the challenges associated with LDC graduation scheduled for 2026. In
addition, we hope this report will support the Government of Bangladesh in considering the significance
of boosting foreign direct investment via reforms in investment policies, cross-border trade facilitation,
rebranding Bangladesh, and via diversified promotion activities in Bangladesh. We would also like to
extend our gratitude to our senior experts Prof. Syed Munir Khasru, Mr. Mohammad Masudur Rahman,
Margub Kabir, and Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury. Without their input, completion of this report

would not have been possible.

We extend our indebtedness to Mr. Tapan Kanti Ghosh, Senior Secretary, Ministry of Commerce,
Bangladesh, whose aspirations have played an essential role in shaping this study. We are also indebted
to the officials and experts who took part in the validation workshop and guided us with their

constructive criticism and valuable feedback.

This work would not have been possible without the valuable input we received during the data
collection period from relevant stakeholders involved in Key Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus

Group Discussions (FGD).

Given the consistent guidance we have received throughout the duration of this project, we were able
to ensure that the study design is closely knit with the current aspirations of Bangladesh in trade
expansion, trade harmonization, transit, transport, infrastructure development, improving ease of doing
business, and facilitation of FDI in Bangladesh. Besides, the research provided us with the opportunity
to reflect on the existing investment policies in Bangladesh and how it may be improved via inspiration

from international best practices to ease the process of LDC Graduation in 2026.

Preface

This report has been prepared by The Institute for Policy, Advocacy, and Governance (IPAG) in joint
venture partnership with e.Gen Consultants Ltd. in accordance with the terms of reference of the
‘Selection of a Consultancy Firm for Policy Study/Policy Review/Rules and Regulation Preparation’
under the BRCP project 1. The core objective of the project is to provide policy feedback through a
policy review of the BIDA Act 2016 under the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority
(BIDA) for advancing the concept of cooperation in trade, investment, transport, and transit
facilitation. Additionally, the assessment will encourage advocacy for policy matters concerning
female traders and foster alignment between a country's developmental goals and its international
commitments in the area of trade facilitation. Furthermore, the policy recommendations chalked out
by this study aspires to benefit policy makers and other stakeholders in supporting trade expansion

and diversification of Bangladesh’s exports.

With a primary focus on the anticipated LDC Graduation in 2026, this study aims to achieve several
objectives. Firstly, it has been prepared to conduct a thorough review of the BIDA Act 2016.
Secondly, the goal is to gather insights from the policy through consultations with the organization
responsible for the BIDA Act 2016 and relevant stakeholders. This aims to pinpoint areas where
coordination and foreign direct investment facilitation can be improved, and to highlight any obstacles
in implementation that both government stakeholders and investors frequently encounter in
Bangladesh. Thirdly, the study seeks to identify the necessary legislative, administrative, and policy
reforms required to ensure a smooth flow of foreign direct investment and harmonized trade
facilitation, among other aspects. Lastly, it aims to analyze how the reforms and recommendations
derived from research, analysis, and stakeholder consultations can contribute to enhancing the Ease of

Doing Business in the region.

Executive Summary

Bangladesh's unwavering dedication to enhancing its investment climate positions it as a promising hub
for future investments, poised to contribute significantly to the nation's economic advancement. On that
note, the BIDA Act was passed on September 1, 2016, through which, the Bangladesh Investment
Development Authority (BIDA) was formed. The Act has mandated BIDA with the responsibility of
delivering diverse promotional and facilitative services to expedite the industrial growth of the nation.

This report assesses the significant role played by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority
(BIDA) in facilitating and promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) within the context of the BIDA
Act 2016. The review offers a comprehensive analysis of the BIDA Act, examines its implications, gaps
in policy and regulatory framework and presents strategic recommendations for optimizing its
effectiveness in enhancing Bangladesh's appeal to foreign investors. As per BIDA Act 2016 provisions,
BIDA’s functions include pre-investment counseling, the registration and approval of private industrial
projects, endorsement of branch/liaison/representative offices, visa recommendations, work permits for
foreign nationals, approval of royalty remittances, technical know-how, and technical assistance fees as
well as after care. The BIDA Act 2016 also ensures that BIDA oversees import of capital machinery
and raw materials, approving foreign loans and supplier credits, and offering aftercare facilities to
further support the industrial landscape.

Chapter 1 of the report opens with an introduction, covering background context of investment in
Bangladesh, an overview of BIDA, and the scope and rationale supporting the study. Moreover, the
section highlights the fundamental importance of FDI as a catalyst for economic growth and
development in Bangladesh. Additionally, the research tools such as Key Informant Interview, Focus
Group Discussion, Legal Analysis, and Comparative Analysis among others, that were used to prepare
this report were provided in detail in this section.

Chapter 2 provides a global comparison of FDI, mainly covering the ASEAN and SAARC region, and
is followed by a descriptive section on FDI inflows in Bangladesh where the report indicates that
Bangladesh experienced a 20.2% FDI increase in 2022, reaching $3.48 billion, the second highest ever,
as reported by Unctad's World Investment Report 2023 and Bangladesh Bank. Moreover, this section
illustrates graphs and figures depicting FDI Gross Inflows and FDI net inflows in Bangladesh between
2020 to 2022 among others.

Chapter 3 focuses on the regulatory framework governing foreign direct investment in Bangladesh, with
particular emphasis on the Foreign Private Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FPIPPA) 1980,
which serves as the primary regulatory framework for foreign investment in the country.

Chapter 4 chalks out a brief overview of BIDA, the history behind BIDA’s formation, the management
structure, and concise description of the BIDA Act 2016. Additionally , details are provided on the recent
investment promotion activities conducted by BIDA from 2021 to 2022 which included activities in the
Dubai Expo 2020, the Bangladesh Investment Climate Improvement (BICI) Program, and the first
International Investment Summit in 2021 hosting over 3000 participants from 27 countries among other
activities. Additionally, brief overviews are provided on other IPAs including Bangladesh Economic
Zones Authority (BEZA), Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA), and the
Bangladesh High-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA).

Chapter 5 serves as a critical examination of the policy-level shortcomings and disparities in
implementation of investment promotion activities and services to investors. The chapter also covers
the National Industrial Policy 2022 and the Export Policy 2021-2024 to determine diversified export
sectors for Bangladesh, further touching upon the priority sectors under the policies. All in all, this
section delves into issues ranging from bureaucratic hurdles to the complexities within the legal
framework. Moreover, this chapter elucidates opportunities for improvement, including the imperative
for enhanced coordination among government entities and the streamlining of investment procedures.
Besides, other aspects such as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, repatriation, provisions of
foreign ownership, provisions of an exit policy, Intellectual Property Rights, and comparison of
investment incentives between Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia have been covered
here.

Chapter 6 establishes a comparison of international good practices across India, Viet Nam, Thailand,
and Malaysia in developing foreign investment through policies and laws, institutional practices on
investment promotion, investment incentives, foreign investment promotion strategy, investment entry
and establishment, and provisions on investment protection.

Chapter 7 reports the key findings collected via desk review, interviews and focus group discussion.
Through the findings, the research team was able to note down some of the key areas for diversifying
investment promotion in Bangladesh. The section further discusses the institutional capacity of BIDA
and highlights BIDA's proactive efforts to attract foreign investment through various initiatives like
roadshows, seminars, and pre-consultations. However, despite receiving positive feedback for its timely
services, there are concerns about BIDA's insufficient manpower and outdated website. Moreover, the
section asserts the need for capacity-building initiatives and improved marketing strategies to enhance
BIDA's visibility and appeal to foreign investors.

Chapter 8 provides a set of well-considered recommendations aimed at boosting the investment climate
in Bangladesh. These recommendations encompass dispute resolution mechanisms, inter-agency
coordination, procedures for outward remittances, capacity-building initiatives, and robust systems for
monitoring and evaluation, among others. Furthermore, this section has chalked out a matrix that delves
into the provisions under the BIDA Act 2016 using a legal analysis further supported by review of
similar policies and legislations from Vietnam, India, Thailand, and Malaysia. Some additions that have
been suggested including, but are not limited to, provisions of having representatives from the private
sector and research backgrounds in the Governing Board to have a holistic approach, stipulating a fixed
time and increased frequency for the Governing Board meeting, inter-agency cooperation as one of the
functions with a view to resolving issues arising from the investor, provision of a database on market
and industries etc.

Finally, the conclusion of the report establishes a concise summary of the report's key findings,
overarching recommendations, and the overarching significance of FDI in propelling Bangladesh
toward sustained economic growth and development. It underlines the commitment of Bangladesh to
improving its investment climate and its readiness to welcome future investments.

The research findings, along with insights gathered from key informant interviews and focus group
discussions, point towards key recommendations. These recommendations emphasize the potential for
enhancing institutional coordination and standardizing policies, suggesting that BIDA should prioritize
these areas in collaboration with the relevant ministries. Also, since foreign investors find the process
of repatriation of profit cumbersome, simplification of the procedure coupled with a smooth exit policy

is recommended. Additionally, government officials should adopt an approachable attitude towards
investors to encourage feedback. As suggested by several respondents, Bangladesh should shift its focus
toward strengthening backward linkage industries to attract investments in industries such as the
automobile industry. Findings have also suggested that the incorporation of IP rights will slow down
the progress for a few years in Bangladesh but eventually capture a wider international market which
would be beneficial in the long run. Investment diversification prospects that have been suggested by
experts, investors, and government officials include ICT, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agro-processing,
steel, plastic, edible oil, leather, man-made fiber among others. Moreover, a specific mechanism to
address disputes settlement should be included in the BIDA Act 2016. However, investor state dispute
should be included as a provision in the mother law i.e., FPIPPA 1980. Similarly, a mechanism to
address grievances may be adopted under the OSS Act 2018, further extending towards BIDA.

Overall, this report serves as a resource for policymakers, potential investors, and stakeholders
interested in understanding and navigating Bangladesh's investment landscape. It offers a
comprehensive analysis of the current state of investment promotion and identifies challenges and
presents rational recommendations for fostering an even more inviting and investment-friendly
environment.

1. Introduction

Bangladesh has achieved significant progress in poverty reduction, employment growth, healthcare,
education, and infrastructure development. It relies heavily on exports for its GDP, but it's about to
graduate from the LDC group in 2026, which will result in a loss of trade benefits, notably in European
markets. As a result, the private sector must prepare to compete on price and quality.

To unlock our full productive potential, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has prioritized investment
promotion as a Special Initiative. This is crucial as Bangladesh work towards a seamless LDC
graduation in 2026 and aim to become an upper-middle-income nation by 2031, ultimately reaching
developed country status by 2041.

To navigate this transition, the government should promote foreign investment, which can help mitigate
the challenges tied to the loss of preferential trade access. Bangladesh is a hub linking China, India, and
ASEAN nations, and is equipped with political stability and forward-thinking foreign policy. Hence,
foreign investment can infuse capital, technology, skills, and market connections, improving economic
productivity, competitiveness, and diversity, while also creating jobs and generating revenue.

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), apex investment promotion agency (IPA)
of Bangladesh, is instrumental in this process. In 2016, BIDA was formed through the BIDA Act with
a primary focus on foreign and local investments and leveraging underutilized government assets to
boost the nation's economic activities. BIDA's role includes investment promotion, policy advocacy,
investor support, pre and post establishment facilitation, land acquisition assistance, and policy
advocacy. The agency also monitors investments and collaborates with international entities to attract
foreign investments. With an emphasis on transparency and investor-friendly policies and having
successfully secured approximately 65% of an $11 billion investment fund over the past four years,
BIDA is well-positioned to promote Bangladesh as an appealing destination for local and foreign
investors. BIDA has framed several policies to support investment and industrial development through
diversified promotional services such as the BIDA Act 2016 and the BIDA One Stop Service Act 2018.

At present, there are three key Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) in Bangladesh besides BIDA,
those being, Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), Bangladesh Export Processing Zones
Authority (BEPZA), the Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA). Besides the four essential
IPAs, there is also the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Authority, which promotes domestic and foreign
investments in specific zones and industries.

1.1 Background

The Bangladesh Regional Connectivity Project 1 (BRCP-1) is jointly being implemented by the
Bangladesh Lank Port Authority (BLPA), National Board of Revenue (NBR) and Ministry of
Commerce and financed by the International Development Association (IDA) — a member of the World
Bank Group. The second component of this umbrella project is being implemented as a separate
technical assistance project by the Ministry of Commerce, and aims to strengthen trade related
institutional capacity to ensure active and sustainable cooperation between multiple trade related
stakeholders and empower women trade through the three following components:

- Component A: Create (pilot) programs to assist female merchants and business owners. This
component will test initiatives to address barriers that prevent women from participating in
regional and global supply chains and trading opportunities.

- Component B: Support for the National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committee's
(NTTFC) capacity development. The inter-ministerial NITFC was established to coordinate
all trade and transportation-related policies and practices in Bangladesh, and to function as the
Project's Advisory Committee.

- Component C: The Bangladesh Trade Portal will be improved, and a National Enquiry Point
for Trade will be established. In March 2016, the Bangladesh Trade Portal (BTP) was launched.
This component will help to improve the BTP's functionality by allowing it to include
information relevant to potential Bangladesh exporters and ensuring that the content is kept up
to date. This component will also establish the National Enquiry Point for Trade, which will
assist Bangladesh in meeting a crucial WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement obligation.

Part of the IDA Credit will be used by the Ministry of Commerce to conduct studies on existing trade
agreements to build a deeper understanding of the three relevant areas of trade facilitation indicated
above.

1.2 Rationale of the Study

Bangladesh's graduation from the LDC category will have significant implications for its GDP and in
turn will lose some of the preferential market access and international support measures that Bangladesh
currently enjoys as an LDC, such as duty-free and quota-free exports, concessional loans, and technical
assistance. These benefits have helped Bangladesh to boost its exports, especially in the garment sector,
and to finance its development needs. According to some estimates, graduation could lead to a loss of
about 8-10% of its gross export revenue, amounting to about $2.5 billion annually.

Therefore, it is vital for Bangladesh to focus on attracting more FDI as it can help overcome some of
the challenges and risks associated with graduation, such as losing competitiveness, diversifying
exports, upgrading technology, and creating jobs. FDI can provide capital, technology, skills, and
market linkages that can enhance the productivity , competitiveness, and diversification of Bangladesh's
economy.

One of the key factors that can help Bangladesh to attract more FDI is to improve its investment climate
and policies. Bangladesh needs to address some of the existing barriers and constraints that hinder FDI
inflows, such as inadequate infrastructure, complex regulations, weak governance, and low skills.
Bangladesh also needs to take proactive measures to promote FDI in strategic sectors that can contribute
to its sustainable development and LDC graduation.

In that context, it is essential to explore the various provisions put forth by BIDA and identify the
challenges and gaps that may interrupt the continuous growth of the FDI in the economy. Furthermore,
a comparison of the investment climate of the comparator economies is also necessary for reforming
policies and acts for making the country a front-runner in attracting FDI.

1.4 Methodology

1.4.1 Document Review

Keeping in consideration the nature of the two policy studies, our team of experts reviewed both primary
and secondary documents during the desk study.

Primary Documents: The team of experts looked at important papers from the Ministry of Commerce
and other trade-related offices. Some of the papers were the BIDA, Foreign Private Investment
(Promotion and Protection) Act (FPIPPA) and OSS ACT, a review of Bangladesh's investment policies,
and investment deals with other countries. Additionally, the collection of primary documents featured
transcripts of the KII and FGD conducted as part of this study.

Secondary Documents: Secondary documents included journal articles, news articles, commentaries
by trade and policy experts, among others. Additionally, the team further relied on papers published by
multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, WTO, and UNCTAD among others, research papers
published by other think tanks based in Bangladesh, and annual reports published by BIDA and BEZA.

1.4.2 Key Informant Interview

Under the scope of the study, qualitative data has been collected in the form of KII. The sample size is
10, and the 10 key informants have been selected by the National Trade Expert/ Trade Economist in
‘consultation with the Team Leader using purposive sampling technique for each study. The sample
consists of government officials from various ministries and their subdivisions, trade agencies, and
foreign investors. The list of participants who were involved in this study has been provided in Annex
1.

1.4.3 Focus Group Discussions

The consultant team carried out the FGD in mixed groups and ensured women participants. The
preferred size of the group was between 6 _ 8 participants as opposed to a group size of 10 — 12 because
if the FGDs incorporate too many experts, it might put forth varying opinions, and divert from the
subject matter. One FGD was conducted, and the FGD participants were selected using snowball or

1 Snowball sampling or chain-referral sampling is defined as a non-probability sampling technique in which the samples have
traits that are rare to find.

commonly known as purposive sampling." The team of consultants held a discussion with the
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), for the purpose of this study.

1.4.4 Data Analysis

In this section, we have listed out the data analysis tools our team of experts have used below:

1.4.4.1 Comparative Policy Analysis

Comparative policy analysis involves the examination and comparison of policies or their outcomes
across different jurisdictions or settings. This method aims to identify best practices and lessons learned
in various contexts. It is valuable for understanding how different policies have been implemented and
their impact in different regions.

Using a comparative lens, our team of experts will compare the policies of the BIDA Act 2016 to the
foreign investment policies of other countries in the region, such as India, Vietnam, Thailand, and
Malaysia. This analysis helped in identifying successful approaches and practices that can be applied
to the context of Bangladesh. By comparing policies and their effects across different regions, the team
acquired insights into what has worked well in other settings.

1.4.4.2 Legal Analysis

Legal analysis is a process that involves the systematic examination and evaluation of legal issues,
principles, and rules to understand their implications, consequences, and application in specific
situations or cases. This entails identifying all parties affected by a policy, assessing their interests,
positions, alliances, and significance. In our project, we applied a legal perspective to scrutinize two
policies, seeking amendments and recommendations.

Within this project, the legal analysis involved a comprehensive review of policies within the BIDA
Act 2016. The team examined how this act impacted various stakeholders, including businesses,
government entities, and international organizations. This examination facilitated an understanding of
the legal framework guiding investment policies, their alignment with both national and international
laws, and identified areas for potential improvements.

2. Over view of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

2.1 Global Comparison

Over the preceding five years, there has been a noteworthy upswing in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
flows across all prominent regional economic groupings within the developing Asian region.
Particularly, investments within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have witnessed
an impressive 41% surge, accumulating to a total of $222 billion. Similar patterns of growth were
discernible within the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Gulf Cooperation
Council, and among member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

As of the year 2022, within East Asia, China has emerged as a substantial participant, marking a
noteworthy 5% upswing, resulting in a substantial influx of FDI, amounting to $189 billion. This
increase can be predominantly attributed to investments in the manufacturing and high-tech sectors,
with a significant impetus provided by European multinational enterprises.

In the context of South-East Asia, the FDI landscape in countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia also
showcased positive trends, with FDI increasing by 14% and 4%, leading to FDI totals of $18 billion
and $22 billion, respectively. Conversely, the Philippines faced a 23% decline, primarily attributable to
divestments.

In the Western Asian region, Saudi Arabia encountered a notable 59% reduction in FDI, amounting to
$7.9 billion. In stark contrast, the United Arab Emirates reached historic highs with a remarkable 10%
increase, totaling $23 billion and attracting the fourth-highest number of global greenfield projects.
Turkey also drew attention with a 9% increase, resulting in $13 billion in FDI.

Furthermore, in South Asia, India's FDI landscape has been particularly remarkable, with a
commendable 10% increase, reaching an impressive $49 billion. This positions India as the third-largest
host country for greenfield projects and the second largest for international project finance deals.
Notably, Bangladesh experienced a significant 20% increase in FDI, reaching a total of $3.5 billion,
marking the second-highest level in the country's history, as reported in UNCTAD's World Investment
Report 2023 2.

2.1.1 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Inflows in Bangladesh

The history of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh between 2003 and 2023 shows a dynamic
economic landscape with notable fluctuations. Bangladesh experienced a 20.2% FDI increase in 2022,
reaching $3 48 billion, the second highest ever, as reported by Unctad's World Investment Report 2023
and Bangladesh Bank. This marks a $584.39 million uptick from 2021 and a 35.7% rise compared to
2020. The following table illustrates the overall growth in FDI Gross Inflows and FDI net inflows

3. Policy Framework for Investment in Bangladesh

Bangladesh welcomes foreign investment with open arms, providing attractive incentives and robust
protection measures for foreign investors. This commitment to promoting and safeguarding foreign
investments is enshrined in various Bangladeshi policies, often employed to portray Bangladesh as an
appealing destination for foreign investors.

The government of Bangladesh has introduced an "Open Door Policy" aimed at enticing foreign
investment. The official body responsible for promoting, attracting, and facilitating foreign investment
within the Export Processing Zones (EPZs) operates under the Prime Minister's Office and is known as
the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA). EPZs are established with the primary
objective of creating designated areas that offer a welcoming investment climate, free from burdensome
regulations, to attract potential investors.

In 2015, the government made a significant decision to establish 100 economic zones (EZs) across the
country, with the goals of attracting both domestic and foreign investment, expediting industrialization,
creating one crore jobs, and increasing exports by an additional $40 billion worth of goods and services
by 2030. While many of these EZs are yet to commence operations, the ones that have been in existence
since FY 2017-18 have already garnered $1.6 billion in investments, including $80 million from foreign
sources. Furthermore, investment proposals totaling $26 billion have been signed across all 97
economic zones. Even though BIDA ACT 2016 governs the regulatory framework for investment
promotion in Bangladesh including investment protection and entry, the Foreign Private Investment
Promotion and Protection Act (FPIPPA) 1980 is the key regulatory framework of foreign investment in
Bangladesh. The broader policy and regulatory framework for catering investment include:

4. Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA):
Context and Challenges

4.1 Overview of BIDA

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), established under the BIDA Act 2016 on
September 1, 2016, plays a central role in expediting the economic and industrial development of
Bangladesh. The organization was formed through the merger of the Board of Investment and
Privatization Commission. BIDA's core mission is to simplify and accelerate the investment process in
the country, consolidating functions previously dispersed among multiple organizations, including the
Board of Investment (BOI).

BIDA actively promotes investment opportunities in various sectors of the economy, both domestically
and internationally. It markets Bangladesh as an attractive destination for both foreign and domestic
investors. In addition, BIDA plays a role in formulating and recommending policies and regulations
that improve the investment climate and works to remove barriers and create a more favorable business
environment. Furthermore, BIDA plays a critical role in monitoring and evaluating investment progress
in the country, ensuring adherence to regulations and promptly addressing any emerging issues during
the investment process. BIDA's involvement in policy advocacy centers on the identification and
resolution of critical policy concerns impacting Bangladesh's investment environment. The agency
conducts analyses of regulatory obstacles, administrative intricacies, and trade impediments,
subsequently offering policy reform suggestions to the government. The authority also conducts
training programs and workshops to enhance the skills and knowledge of government officials,
investors, and other stakeholders involved in the investment process. BIDA operates as a
comprehensive one-stop service provider for investors, offering a wide range of services, including
streamlined online registration and approval processes. This approach significantly reduces
bureaucratic hurdles and simplifies compliance with regulatory requirements for both local and foreign
investors.

All in all, BIDA is a key driver in creating a transparent and favorable investment environment in
Bangladesh, with a specific focus on attracting both local and foreign investments, thereby contributing
to the country's economic growth and development.

4.2 Overview of the BIDA Act 2016

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Act 2016, which came into effect on
September 1, 2016, was established to expedite the country's industrial progress. BIDA was assigned
the role of delivering a comprehensive set of promotional and facilitative services. The BIDA Act aimed
to streamline bureaucratic procedures and provide incentives to foster a more investor-friendly
atmosphere? and BIDA came into existence under this act. BIDA has offered several incentives for the
promotion of foreign investment in Bangladesh. Moreover, the government has offered several facilities
for foreign investors such as Special Economic Zones, Export Processing Zones, etc. *

The BIDA Act 2016 outlines the functions, powers, and responsibilities of BIDA and provides a legal
framework for its operation. Under the Act, the authority operates as a one-stop service provider,

simplifying the investment process by centralizing a variety of services. This includes online
registration and approval processes, reducing administrative complexities and enhancing investors'
ability to navigate regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the Act empowered BIDA to grant incentives
such as tax exemptions, duty-free machinery imports, and other advantages, particularly for priority
sectors. BIDA also actively participates in promoting investment opportunities both domestically and
internationally by engaging in roadshows and investment seminars.

The Act outlines specific regulations for foreign investment promotion and facilitation as well as the
formation of the investment promotion agency, BIDA, in Bangladesh. It also provides guidelines for
foreign investor entry into Bangladesh. The Act includes a regulatory framework for licensing or
approving industrial undertakings, whether they involve domestic or foreign investment or joint
ventures. While foreign investors typically do not require approval under the FPIPPA 1980, the BIDA
Act mandates that individuals seeking to establish private sector industrial undertakings must apply for
approval following specified procedures, except for industries governed by established legal
institutions. It's important to note that BIDA's jurisdiction is limited to industrial undertakings, and
therefore, service subsectors not categorized as industries in the Industrial Policy fall outside BIDA's
purview, missing out on its support. The BIDA Act also incorporates provisions to promote investment,
including one-stop services aimed at expeditiously delivering infrastructure services to industrial
undertakings based on their requirements. 4

4.4 Promoting Investment: BIDA's Recent Initiatives

Under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s special initiative known as Biniyog Bikash (Investment
Promotion), BIDA, as lead agency for overseeing business climate, implemented various investment
promotion and investment facilitation activities. BIDA joined Dubai Expo 2020 which took place in
2022 and assumed regional directorship for South Asia at the World Association of Investment
Promotion Agencies (WAIPA) for 2021-2023.

BIDA further developed the Bangladesh Investment Climate Improvement (BICI) Program to kickstart
business climate reforms across Bangladesh. Additionally, BIDA is developing an Investor
Relationship Management System (IRMS) guided by the Strategic Roadmap 2020-2024 to strategize

15

empowering people

communications and implement IPA services effectively. The system will manage interactions,
implement monitoring and surveys, and manage investors’ databases.

BIDA also organized its first International Investment Summit in 2021 hosting over 3000 participants
from 27 countries where they exhibited 11 of Bangladesh’s thriving sectors that hold great potential for
foreign investment. The agency has taken another step further to streamline information for the public
including investors by launching its new website which highlights the priority sectors in Bangladesh,
provides an investment roadmap, and easier access to services.

In parallel, the FGD findings raised several key initiatives by BIDA to facilitate foreign investments.
One notable initiative is the creation of a country-wise liaison officer's list, making it convenient for
foreign investors from specific countries, such as India, Germany, and the United States, to connect
with designated liaison officers. These officers play a crucial role in providing essential information
and support, boosting investor confidence in Bangladesh.

Additionally, BIDA actively collects and shares investment-related information from various
government entities, including the Trade Ministry, Ministry of Industries, and Bangladesh Bank,
ensuring that investors have access to essential data and resources.

4.5 Bangladesh Investment Climate Improvement (BICI) Program

BIDA introduced the Bangladesh Investment Climate Improvement (BICI) Program to enact
comprehensive business climate reforms across the country, aligning with Bangladesh’s socio-
economic context. Following the suspension of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EoDB)
program in September 2021, BIDA was directed to develop a program tailored to Bangladesh’s specific
needs. The directive was issued during the 9th meeting of the National Committee for Monitoring
Implementation of Doing Business. BIDA, as the government’s primary agency for coordinating
business climate reforms, crafted the BICI program, seeking input from stakeholders in a workshop
held on June 16, 2022. The proposed BICI, aligned with Vision-2041, focuses on seven pillars,
including Business Entry, Exit, and Technology Adoption, Industrial Infrastructure and Logistics,
Cross-Border Trade and Business, Commercial Dispute Resolution and Labor Regulations, Tax
Regime, and Financial and Non-financial Incentives and Access to Finance. Departing from generic
assumptions, BICI’s reforms will be informed by the Bangladesh Business Climate Index (BBX) and
structured feedback from the private sector. The program, encompassing 97 proposed reforms for FY
2022-23, is currently under government consideration, and several development partners have
expressed interest in funding the initiative>

an impressive figure of US$ 6,296.24 million. Notably, during the initial eight months of the fiscal year
2022-23, the EPZs achieved a total export value of US$ 5,361.12 million. Significantly, in the fiscal
year 2021-22, the exports from EPZs constituted approximately 16.61 percent of the nation's total export
volume. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that as of February 2023, the industrial establishments operating
within the EPZs, under the supervision of the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA),
have provided gainful employment to 486,304 Bangladeshi citizens. It is particularly significant to
mention that this workforce accounts for a substantial 66 percent of the entire Bangladeshi workforce
employed within EPZs. The following table gives an overview of the investment, export and export in

5. Findings from Secondary Sources: Policy Challenges and
Implementations Gaps

5.1 National Industrial Policy

The Ministry of Industries has issued the National Industry Policy (NIP) for 2022, with its primary
goals being the promotion of entrepreneurship, expansion of export diversification, and the facilitation
of both local and foreign investments.

The primary focus of the NIP is on labor-intensive industrialization using domestic resources. The
policy targets a 40% GDP contribution from industries by 2027, up from 35% in 2016 and 29% in 2010.
While the industrial sector contributed 37.07% in 2021-22, there's a push to reach 41.86% by 2025. The
policy emphasizes gradual growth, with achievements in manufacturing sectors like textiles, garments,
and leather.

The policy stresses the importance of export diversification, increased foreign direct investment (FDI),
and a focus on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Special attention is given to less developed areas,
aiming to ensure a stable supply of raw materials for export-oriented industries. Initiatives include
simplifying administrative procedures, supporting startups, and encouraging ICT-based
entrepreneurship. Women entrepreneurs are promoted with collateral-free loans, although funding
challenges persist.

The policy addresses the formalization of the informal sector, introducing a time-bound action plan.
There's an emphasis on attracting local and foreign investment, improving confidence in organizations
like BSCIC, and implementing initiatives for start-ups. Challenges include financing for women
entrepreneurs, labor productivity behind ASEAN countries, and the need for specific targets to improve
Global Industrial Performance Index (GII) rankings.

The graduation challenges, including loss due to LDC-ISMs, logistics costs, and the need for
digitalization and diversified FDI, are acknowledged. The policy aligns with the goals of other Asian
countries like Malaysia and Vietnam. However, challenges such as poor data management, inconsistent
policies, and the implementation mechanism's effectiveness need attention. The editorial stresses that
while policies are in place, the focus should be on their implementation with a time-bound and strategy-
oriented approach.

5.2 Export Policy 2021 - 2024

The Export Policy, 2021-2024, was made effective from March 23, 2022. The Policy aims to reach
annualized export earnings of US$ 80 billion between the years 2021-2024 with a key focus on post-
LDC-Graduation challenges, research, and development, curbing the impact of COVID-19 on export
sectors, and the fourth industrial revolution. The Policy focuses on boosting trade by tapping into 14
priority sectors with products of high-value potential as mentioned below.

The government of Bangladesh provides incentives to selected export sectors which includes textiles,
hand-made products, jute produces, agricultural and agri-processed goods, leather goods, furniture,
plastic goods, frozen fish, motorycles, among others. Most of these products are already in Bangladesh’s
Export Priority List. The rate of subsidy for these items ranges from 4 — 20 percent. Under the provisions
of the Value Added Tax Act, 1991, and the Customs Act, 1969, all duties and taxes paid on inputs/ raw
materials used for the manufacturing of exported goods is subject to refund.

5.2.1 Priority Sectors

HIGHEST PRIORITY SECTOR

i. High value-added ready-made garments, denim

ii. Man-Made Fiber

iii. Garment Accessories.

iv. Pharmaceutical products.

v. Plastic products.

vi. Footwear (leather, non-leather, and synthetic) and leather goods.

Vii. jute products, including multipurpose jute products.

viii. | Agricultural and processed agricultural products; fruits, cut flowers.

batteries)

x. Construction of ships and sea-going fishing trawlers.

xi. Furniture.

xii. Home Textiles and Home Decor, Terry towel.

xiii. Baggage.

Table 5 Highest Priority Sector

While BIDA is adhering to the National Industrial Policy, as indicated from data collected via the KII
of foreign investors, pharmaceutical products, ICT, electronics (among which, mobile phones
manufacturing), and leather are potential areas where investment may be diversified. KII findings have
complemented this, providing various suggestions for investment diversification e.g., steel, plastic,
leather, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agro-processing, hi-tech, ICT etc.

5.3 Dispute Settlement

An essential concern for foreign investors revolves around the selection of an appropriate dispute
resolution mechanism. Section 4 of the FPIPPA 1980 stipulates that the government is obligated to
provide fair and equitable treatment to foreign private investments, ensuring their full protection and
security within Bangladesh. Due to delays often experienced in Bangladeshi litigation, foreign investors

21

IPAG e+ Sen

empowering people

typically prefer arbitration as their favored method for resolving cross-border commercial disputes '7.
The World Justice Project announces in its Rule of Law Index 2016 that Bangladesh is ranked at 103rd
among 113 countries. Weaknesses in public governance and judicial independence have led to a lack
of confidence in solving commercial disputes through its court system. Arbitration offers flexibility and
allows parties to autonomously resolve conflicts while maintaining confidentiality.

In instances of disputes, dispute resolution methods are available under the Arbitration Act of 2001 and
2004. Bangladesh is a signatory to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID), an organization that settles investment disputes involving specific states and foreign nationals.
Additionally, Bangladeshi law permits contracts to refer dispute settlement to third-country forums,
such as those in Singapore.

Bangladesh is also a participant in the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
Agreement for the Establishment of an Arbitration Council since November 2005, aiming to establish
a permanent center for alternative dispute resolution in one of the SAARC member countries.
Furthermore, Bangladesh is a signatory of the New York Convention, recognizing the enforcement of
international arbitration awards. For dispute resolution, the Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre
(BIAC) is available, operating under the Bangladesh Arbitration Act of 2001. BIAC is an independent
arbitration center established in April 2011 for the resolution of commercial disputes, overseen by a
committee headed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh (ICCB) and
comprising presidents of other prominent chambers, including DCCI and MCCI.

The FPIPPA currently lacks any provisions for investor-state disputes, which are typically found in
bilateral agreements. A provision on investor-state dispute should be explicitly stated in the Act and
designed to be as comprehensive as possible, providing foreign investors with ample freedom and
protection. In most treaties, parties’ consent to settling investor-state disputes through international
arbitration mechanisms, typically ICSID. When investors commit significant funds to a project, they
often seek legal support to ensure their protection. They may not solely rely on the FPIPPA for clarity
and may refer to other documents like bilateral investment treaties or joint investment agreements.

Bangladesh has faced a total of 7 claims from foreign investors, with four cases resolved and three
currently under arbitration. Thus far, no foreign investors have invoked protection under the FPIPPA.
Presently, there is no evidence of ongoing proceedings in national courts. While investors from
countries with bilateral investment treaties receive protection under those treaties, investors from other
nations must rely on the FPIPPA.

The Grievance Redress System functions as a channel for stakeholders to formally submit complaints
to government authorities regarding dissatisfaction with service providers. Its purpose is to identify
opportunities for improving service delivery, enhancing transparency, and ensuring accountability
among service providers. The Government of Bangladesh already employs such a system. However,
when investors’ complaints concern agencies other than BIDA, there is no formal mechanism to address
these issues. In this context, BIDA may address this matter under the OSS (One-Stop Service)
framework, incorporating it into the act and developing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for its
implementation, which would ensure proper resolution of investor complaints. The umbrella law,
FPIPPA should have provisions to ensure the exhaustion of local remedies first before going for a
mutually agreed international dispute settlement forum. The BIDA Act can have a provision dispute
resolution clause empowering the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh or the court

(preferably a commercial court/tribunal) against any grievance arising from any action or inaction of
BIDA. The court/tribunal can follow the procedure as laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
and the Arbitration Act, 2001.

5.4 Inter-agency Coordination Gaps

While BIDA is responsible for facilitating investment promotion, every IPA has a separate mandate
which does not require them to coordinate as indicated by KII findings. Though BIDA plays the role of
a facilitator, some approvals are generally granted by other organizations.

To streamline the procedures for setting up an investment/business, an overarching power is missing.
In this regard, FGD findings have presented an interest from BIDA's end to adopt an overarching power
for overseeing the overall activities under the umbrella of the OSS. Some KII respondents have
reiterated a similar interest, expressing the need for a dedicated authority to oversee all procedures.
BIDA in this regard, can follow the model of Vietnam's Foreign Investment Agency (FIA), which
functions as the central administrative body responsible for investment matters at the national level.

Moreover, BIDA is a part of the Central OSS Authority, and the efficiency of the OSS is affected due
to inter-agency coordination. Inter-agency coordination is essential to the efficiency of the OSS as it is
a host portal which offers services from various agencies, that are to be offered within a prescribed
timeframe. While BIDA and BEZA offer various services through the OSS system, the platform offers
more than 125 services to investors, involving over 35 government agencies, therefore, inter-agency
coordination emerges as a pivotal element in ensuring the system operates effectively.

From a legal perspective, the OSS Act may include a provision for incorporating coordination
mechanism into every IPA mandate with BIDA acting as the central authority in charge of overseeing
coordination.

5.5 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement

Foreign investors have the opportunity to prevent double taxation through the Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is empowered to engage in
negotiations with foreign countries to encourage foreign direct investment (FDIs) in Bangladesh.
DTAA is a mutual agreement between two countries aimed at preventing double taxation by outlining
each country's taxation jurisdiction concerning international income flows and offering tax credits or
exemptions to eliminate the risk of double taxation. DTAA also facilitates the sharing of information
between treaty partners to combat tax evasion. Below is the list of countries that have signed bilateral
DTAA agreements with Bangladesh.

Bangladesh and India led to confusion for Indian companies regarding double taxation avoidance
agreements. The tax year in Bangladesh spans from June to July, whereas in India, it runs from March

empowering people

to April. This variance necessitates a certificate from companies verifying tax payments made during
the March-April period. However, the government hasn't been issuing these certificates, creating
obstacles in the process for India.

5.6 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are the legal protections afforded to the creators or owners of
intellectual property, which includes works of literature, art, inventions, designs, names, symbols, and
pictures used in commerce. By giving creators and inventors ownership over their works and allowing
them to profit monetarily from their intellectual investments, these rights are crucial for promoting
innovation and creativity.

Intellectual property and investment are closely interrelated in the business and economic perspective.
The “Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)” by the WTO sets
out the minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights among its member states.
Under this agreement, member countries have the option, though not an obligation, to enact more
extensive intellectual property protection in their laws, provided that such protection aligns with the
agreement’s provisions. As a member of the WTO, Bangladesh has an obligation to follow the minimum
standard as set in the TRIPS agreement. Accordingly, Bangladesh has amended Intellectual Property
related laws and regulations. For example, by repealing the previous Patents and Designs Act, 1911
(Act No. II of 1911) the new Patent Act, 2022 was passed and the industry-design bill was passed in
2023 18. Further, with a view to creating an enabling environment towards practicing IPRs effectively,
the government has taken some initiatives. As an example, on 15 November 2018, the National
Innovation and Intellectual Property Policy, 2018 was introduced. In addition, to address unlawful
activities in connection with infringement of Intellectual Property Rights at the border, the National
Board of Revenue (NBR) introduced the IPR Enforcement (Import and Export) Rules, 2019, utilizing
the authority conferred by sections 15, 16, and 17 of the Customs Act, 1969. All these initiatives would
be investment friendly if they are practiced properly.

Existing literature suggests that the role of Intellectual Property (IP) in promoting Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) is multifaceted, and various aspects highlight its significance in attracting and
sustaining investment. Intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, serve
as incentives for innovation. Evidence shows that FDI often flows to countries with robust IP protection
as investors seek environments that encourage and reward innovation. Keith E. Maskus in his article
“Intellectual Property Rights in the Global Economy” shows that enhanced protection of Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) is expected to boost motivations for innovation and elevate the rewards
associated with international technology transfer '°. In addition to that investor, particularly in
technology-intensive industries, are more likely to invest in countries with strong IP protection to
safeguard their investments in research and development. FDI often involves technology transfer and
licensing agreements. Branstetter, L. (2000) argues that Countries with reliable IP protection
mechanisms are more likely to attract foreign investors looking to leverage local technologies. Eaton,
J., & Kortum, S. (1996) suggested that a country’s commitment to IP protection can influence investors’

decisions to enter new markets. Strong IP protection enhances the ability of businesses to differentiate
their products and services 20.

In this context, based on the above-mentioned pieces of evidence it can be suggested that Bangladesh
needs to emphasize strong Intellectual Property protection to attract increased Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI).

5.7 Technological Transfer and Linkage to Domestic Industries

To foster industries beyond the garment sector and enhance value addition, there's a critical need for
industrial diversification and increased value-adding. Encouragingly, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
plays a pivotal role in transferring the requisite technology for this purpose. However, Bangladesh's
FDI currently stands at only 0.7% of GDP on average for the period 2016-2020, significantly lower
than its counterparts like Vietnam (6.2%), India (1.8%), and the Philippines (2.5%). IPR protection
plays a pivotal role in this regard.

On one hand, IPR Protection can hinder technology spread by restricting access through patents,
potentially resulting in reduced knowledge dissemination due to higher prices and lower output caused
by increased market power among IPR holders. On the other hand, IPRs can facilitate knowledge
diffusion since patent information is accessible to potential inventors. Additionally, robust IPR
protection can promote technology transfer via increased trade, foreign direct investment (FDI),
technology licensing, and joint ventures. Despite this theoretical complexity, the primary benefit of the
TRIPS Agreement is seen as technology diffusion from technologically advanced nations to others,
especially in developing countries with limited innovation capacity.

Bangladesh can adopt case studies from the Southeast Asian region. For instance, Thailand also has
provisions for technology transfer, particularly in the context of foreign investment. According to the
Foreign Business Act of 1999, foreign investors who wish to engage in restricted business activities in
Thailand must prepare and submit a technology transfer plan as part of their application for a Foreign
Business License.”!

Furthermore, Vietnam's Law on Investment 2020 includes provisions for investment incentives, which
cover projects with technology transfer on the list of technologies encouraged for transfer under the law
on technology transfer. This indicates that the law acknowledges and incentivizes technology transfer,
particularly in the context of foreign investments.

To improve technology transfer, enhancing the investment climate is crucial. This includes simplifying
the repatriation of royalties, fees related to technical assistance, streamlining the process for expatriate
work permits, revising import tariffs, and fostering stronger connections between FDI assemblers and
domestic suppliers. Additionally, establishing a dedicated division within Investment Promotion
Agencies (IPAs) for linkage development is essential for this facilitation.

5.8 Free Trade agreements (FTAs), Multilateral Trade Agreements, and
Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs)

As a least developed country (LDC), Bangladesh currently enjoys GSP/DFQF preferences from 21
destinations. However, with Bangladesh's anticipated graduation from LDC status in 2026, the
continuation of this duty-free access will cease post-graduation. This presents a significant challenge to
maintaining the consistent progress achieved in bilateral export trade with key export destination

empowering people

markets. In response, the consideration of a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has arisen as an
alternative method to preserve duty-free market access in those destinations. Nevertheless, engaging in
such an FTA comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, as it entails the exchange of
reciprocal preferences.

Furthermore, the emergence of cross-regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) represents a significant
shift in the recent international trade system. This trend sets these agreements apart from their
predecessors in terms of economic importance, broader geographic coverage, and a more extensive
range of trade-related matters, including Intellectual Property and Investment. Concurrently, the
establishment of mega-regional trade agreements (MRTAs) marks the next phase in the evolution of
regionalism, posing both an advancement and a considerable challenge for the global economy, the
existing pattern of globalization, and the equilibrium of power. If Bangladesh seeks to join these
MRTAs, it will need to adopt stringent provisions related to Investment and Intellectual Property in its
domestic regulations. Additionally, compliance with numerous cross-cutting issues between IP and
investment within these agreements will be necessary.

However, it's worth noting that the WTO agreements do not include specific legal provisions dictating
the scope and standards of Investment Chapters within Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Parties to the
FTAs have the freedom to define their own parameters and criteria for Investment, allowing them to
establish multiple, higher-level standards based on specific regulatory objectives. Typically, investment
is addressed as an individual provision in Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) that include distinct
investment provisions covering the broader definition and scope of investment, pre-establishment and
post-establishment commitments, general matters, and mechanisms for settling disputes between
investors and states.

Literature suggests that both developed and developing nations adopt an expansive definition of
investment in their Free Trade Agreements, regardless of their developmental stage. Countries employ
varying approaches to specify this extensive coverage. For example, the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP) includes a comprehensive definition of investment, specifying its
particular characteristics, and follows pre-establishment commitments. Meanwhile, RCEP lacks a
distinct Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision and establishes a work plan to initiate ISDS
discussions no later than two years after the agreement's entry into force. In contrast, many countries
have included distinct clauses and procedures under the investment chapter in most cases of forming
FTAs to resolve Investor-State Disputes (ISDs). Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) often have
separate provisions for resolving ISDs under the investment chapter, referencing institutions such as
ICSID, Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, the arbitration rules of UNCITRAL, or other agreed-upon
instruments for ISD. However, a trend is observed in some RTAs, such as the Malaysia-Pakistan FTA
and Malaysia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, where parties incorporate their own arbitration
mechanisms, including the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration as an option.

The patterns of FDI portray Bangladesh more as a destination for inbound FDI rather than an originator
of outward investments. Approval from the Bangladesh Bank on a case-by-case basis is necessary for
any outward investment from Bangladesh. As per Bangladesh’s FPIPPA Act of 1980, the government
has the authority to approve foreign private investment based on its potential contribution to:

* the development of capital, technical and managerial resources of Bangladesh; or
* the discovery, mobilization or better utilization of the natural resources; or

* the strengthening of the balance of payment of Bangladesh; or

* increasing employment opportunities in Bangladesh; or

* — the economic development of the country in any other manner.

27

IPAG e+ Sen

empowering people

Bangladesh has entered into various bilateral investment treaties with different nations, in addition to
several regional agreements that include provisions related to investments. So far, Bangladesh has
signed BITs with 33 countries: United Kingdom, Germany, BLEU (Belgium-Luxembourg Economic
Union), France, United States of America, Korea, Republic of, Romania, Turkey, Italy, Canada,
Netherlands, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Poland, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Dem. People's
Rep. of, Uzbekistan, Switzerland, Austria, Iran, Thailand, Singapore, Viet Nam, India, Denmark,
United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Cambodia, Bahrain, Kuwait. In many instances, the treaties outline
procedures for resolving Investor-State Disputes 22, along with provisions for addressing disputes
between the involved parties.

Ata regional level, Bangladesh signed the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) in 1993
and the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in 2004 which succeeded SAPTA in
2006. Bangladesh is also member of Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and
Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) since 1997 and a member of APTA (formerly known as the
Bangkok Agreement) which is the oldest preferential regional trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific
region, signed in 1975. Moreover, Bangladesh is also a member of the Developing-8 (D- 8) consisting
of Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey signed in 2006. So far, there are no concrete
provisions for investment treaties, especially bilateral treaties in the BIDA Act 2016 and the OSS 2018.
In the case of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), the parties have mutually consented to engage
in further negotiations to define the detailed procedures for settling Investor-State Disputes and disputes
among the parties.

The FPIPPA Act of 1980 guarantees post-establishment protection but imposes conditions on pre-
establishment commitments during the approval stage. Imposing such conditions on pre-establishment
commitments in a potential Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) could pose challenges for Bangladesh.
Given that FTAs/CEPAs typically emphasize pre-establishment commitments, Bangladesh must decide
whether to maintain this approach in future FTAs or eliminate these conditions, necessitating
amendments to the Act. Addressing these cross-cutting issues may be facilitated through the
incorporation of changes in the FPIPPA Act of 1980 and the BIDA Act, 2016, with potential
amendments to the One Stop Service Act, 2018 for effective implementation.

5.9 Additional Policies for Safeguarding Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)

Bangladesh is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), an entity under the
World Bank that provides insurance coverage to investors against political risks. MIGA aims to assure
foreign investors against non-commercial losses and promote foreign direct investment (FDI). This
guarantee from MIGA safeguards investors from risks related to currency transfer, expropriation,
conflicts, and civil disturbances. It's important to note that MIGA's scope is limited to mitigating risks
for new investments, privatization, and financial restructuring, and provides guarantees for 3 to 15 years
(20 years occasionally). Moreover, MIGA does not provide export credit insurance 23.

The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a U.S.-based entity, offers insurance coverage
to American investments entering emerging markets like Bangladesh. OPIC provides essential

22 The mechanism available for settling ISDs are: competent court of the party where the investment has made; ICSID; UNICITRAL; Arbitration
in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Arbitration Institute of Stockholm Chamber of Commerce; Court of Arbitration of the Paris

5.11 Outward Remittance/ Repatriation

Profit and capital repatriation must adhere to reporting requirements or receive authorization from the
Bangladesh Bank. The following outward remittances can be made with prior approval of Bangladesh

* Payouts of dividends

* Expenses related to training and consulting

* Settling approved foreign loans.

* Royalties, franchise fees, technical licenses, know-how, and assistance fees
* Transfers of shares and securities.

Specialized foreign exchange regulations are applicable to specific industries, including shipping
agents, freight forwarding agents, courier companies, and airline companies.

The government gazette™, ‘The Guidelines for Outward Remittance and Repatriation for Payment of
Royalty, Technical Knowledge/ Technical Know-how Fee(s), Technical Assistance Fees(s), and
Franchise Fee(s)’ was circulated in 2021 which served the purpose of clarifying processes and
procedures for outward remittance and repatriation for payment of royalty, technical knowledge/
technical Know-how Fee(s), technical assistance fees(s), and franchise fee(s) by private industrial
enterprises registered in Bangladesh. This gazette could possibly cut down the time for outward
remittance by 15-20 days and cut the cost of repatriation since no fees have to be paid to BIDA as
authorized dealers will be able to remit directly. Payments surpassing these limits necessitate explicit
approval from BIDA (more than 6% for any given year for royalty) 2১ which doesn’t make outward
remittance simpler. However, BIDA’s another handbook states that a prior-approval by BIDA is
necessary for remitting “any technical fees”. In practice, even if the amount is within the threshold,

BIDA requests the companies to submit “remittance application” with relevant documents. It is also
reported that it takes relatively longer time to judge if the particular of fee remittance is of relevance or
not. Further, those cases where the amount to be remitted exceeds the threshold value may be treated as
special cases in practice, thus subject to relatively stringent appraisal by BIDA’s executive committee.

Similarly, the Foreign Exchange Circular No. 22, issued on August 09, 2016, under the title 'Foreign
Exchange Regulations for Enterprises and Developers in Bangladesh Economic Zones (EZs),' permits
to remit royalty, technical know-how, and technical assistance fees without prior Bangladesh or BEZA
approval if the total fees and expenses don't exceed the specified limits. However, exceeding these
limits requires BEZA's prior approval, and each transaction must be reported to both Bangladesh Bank
and BEZA”>.

Ensuring repatriation of investment/dividend is one of the preconditions of foreign direct investment in
any country. Before transferring profits from foreign subsidiaries to the parent company, it is necessary
to secure approval from the Bangladesh Bank. However, the Bangladesh Bank often presents obstacles
in the process of repatriating profits, which is one of the prerequisites for foreign direct investment
(FDI), ultimately impeding the inflow of FDI. Consequently, international investors encounter
challenges in repatriating their funds or dividends. When private sector industrial enterprises engage in
outward remittances to foreign group entities, they are obligated to perform an arm's length analysis for
outward remittance payments, regardless of the remittance amount. Consequently, applicants must
provide evidence of the arm's length pricing for such transactions to facilitate outward remittances.
Implementing streamlined profit repatriation regulations, similar to those of neighboring countries like
Vietnam or India, could attract more foreign investment into Bangladesh.

Even though the BIDA handbook and foreign exchange guidelines outline the criteria for remitting
royalties, technical know-how/assistance fees, they lack comprehensive procedural instructions or
related details. It is essential for the Bangladesh Bank to issue a circular explicitly stating that these
types of repatriation can be conducted through an integrated approach to simplify and expedite the
process, reducing complications. Regional contemporaries including India, Vietnam, and Indonesia
have simplified laws regarding investments to lure FDI and Bangladesh needs to follow a similar
approach.

5.12 Foreign Ownership Opportunities

Bangladesh broadly welcomes foreign investment, adhering to a principle of non-discrimination, with
most sectors allowing 100 percent foreign ownership. Exceptions requiring local ownership include
roles like freight/cargo forwarding agents, airline/railway/general or pre-shipment service cargo agents,
shipping agents, courier service agents, buying houses, indenting agents, advertising agents, and for-
profit educational institutions.?? However, not all industries permit 100 percent foreign investment,
limiting the involvement of foreign investors in standard activities like establishing Branch Offices in
those particular sectors.

The 2022 National Investment Policy outlines industries subject to regulation and those designated for
exclusive investment, requiring specific approval for investment. According to the 2022 National

Industrial Policy (Paragraph 3.2.14 - Reserved Industry), four sectors are exclusively reserved for
government investment, including arms, ammunition, and defense equipment; forest plantations and
mechanized extraction in reserved forests; nuclear energy production; and security printing (e.g.,
currency). Industries categorized as reserved are not accessible for private investment. Conversely, as
stated in the 2022 National Industrial Policy (Paragraph 3.2.15 - Controlled Industry), there are 22
industries where investments are controlled. These include deep-sea fishing, banking/finance,
insurance, power generation, supply and distribution, natural gas/oil exploration and extraction, coal
exploration and extraction, other mineral resources exploration and extraction, large-scale infrastructure
(e.g., flyover, expressway, monorail, economic zone), crude oil refinery (recycling/refining of lube oil
as fuel), medium and large industries using natural gas/condensate and other minerals as raw material,
telecommunications (mobile/cellular and land phone), satellite channels, cargo/passenger aviation, sea-
bound ship transport, sea-port/deep sea-port, VOIP/IP telephony, industries using heavy minerals
accumulated from the sea beach, explosive production, acid production, chemicals, all kinds of sludge,
and fertilizer made from sludge, stone crashing. Prior to registering with BIDA/BEZA/Hi-Tech
Park/BEPZA, potential investors in controlled industries must obtain a 'No Objection Certificate (NOC)'
from the relevant ministry/division.

Alternatively, the government of Bangladesh provides foreign investors with the chance to conduct
business in the country by permitting them to invest in a subsidiary or a Joint Venture Companies.
Foreign investors have the option to establish a wholly owned company, a subsidiary, or a joint venture
in Bangladesh. Common forms of business incorporation are public or private limited companies. These
companies must adhere to the Companies Act 1994 and are free to engage in any legal business activity
and establish operations anywhere within Bangladesh. The company incorporation process involves
several steps which starts with obtaining a name clearance from the Office of the Registrar of Joint
Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) followed by opening of bank account and preparing the Articles
and Memorandum of Association and submitting an application for incorporation with RSJC which
may take up to 5 weeks.”

In a Joint Venture company, both domestic and international investors collaborate to form an entity
while adhering to the legal requirements. It’s important to note that in the context of foreign investment
in JV companies, particularly those offering freight forwarding services, the ownership structure is
regulated. Foreign investors are restricted to a maximum of 40% share ownership, with the remaining
60% mandated for local investors. This 60/40 local-to-foreign shareholding ratio is a prerequisite for
establishing a JV Logistics Company and subsequently acquiring a freight forwarding license. Both
individual and multiple foreign investors can contribute to a single project, provided there is at least
one local investor.”

5.13 Exit Policy

After completion of commercial objectives, foreign investors can exit or divest their investment in
Bangladesh through the following options

¢ Share Transfer
¢ Business Transfer
¢ Winding Up or Liquidation

An investor has the option to terminate an investment by either convening an annual or extraordinary
general meeting. Upon fulfilling the necessary procedures to exit the country, a foreign investor may
repatriate the net proceeds following the acquisition of proper authorization from the central bank,
which is the Bangladesh Bank.

The current exit policy is considered favorable since it follows international standards and has
measures where investors are guaranteed withdrawal. However, the current exit policy may be more
titled in favor of big investors, and medium sized foreign investors may find the terms, conditions and
dispute settlements fairly difficult.

While the exit policy is quite favorable, the primary concern ultimately revolves around the
repatriation of profits, which may not be as straightforward due to procedural requirements,
approvals, and potential delays.

5.14 Integration of OSS with National Single Window

On February 22, 2017, the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), officially known as the
Agreement on Trade Facilitation, became effective after receiving ratification from two-thirds of WTO
Members, serving as the foundation for this analysis. Primarily centered around Customs-related
matters, the TFA features provisions with varying degrees of binding force, including those that are
obligatory (e.g., Art. 1.1 on Publication), those that are encouraged but not mandatory (e.g., Art. 1.3 on
Enquiry Points), and others that represent a combination of both (e.g., Art. 1.3 on Enquiry Points).
Article 10.4 of this Agreement covers the issue of Single Window which states that “Members shall
endeavour to establish or maintain a single window, enabling traders to submit documentation and/or
data requirements for importation, exportation, or transit of goods through a single-entry point to the
participating authorities or agencies. After the examination by the participating authorities or agencies
of the documentation and/or data, the results shall be notified to the applicants through the single
window in a timely manner.” ১0

Single Windows are formally defined as “facilities that allow parties involved in trade and transport to
lodge standardised information and documents with a single-entry point to fulfil all import, export, and
transit-related regulatory requirements” ১1. Projections of World Trade Organization (WTO) indicate
that the complete enactment of the TFA could lead to an average reduction of 14.3% in trade costs and
potentially increase global trade by as much as $1 trillion annually, with the most significant benefits
accruing to the least developed nations. Govt. of Bangladesh has taken initiatives to implement this
TFA provision of Single Window.

NBR is currently implementing a nationwide single window system in Bangladesh, which aims to
streamline all customs procedures related to foreign trade through a unified interface. This project is
funded by the World Bank and is designed to enhance the ease of conducting business by modernizing
international trade processes with a user-friendly system. To oversee the project, a dedicated
implementation unit has been established, and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) have been
executed with 39 different government and non-government entities.

On the other hand, to enhance investment facilitation services in Bangladesh, the government has
introduced the “One Stop Service Act 2018.” This legislation grants authority to the Bangladesh
Investment Development Authority (BIDA) to implement One Stop Services (commonly known as a
One Stop Shop) for investors, in collaboration with other investment promotion agencies such as the
Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority
(BEPZA), and Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA). The One Stop Services, administered by
BIDA, will function as a unified platform and the sole point of contact between the government and
investors seeking investment-related services outside the special economic zones established by BEZA ,
BEPZA, and BHTPA.

Integrating OSS with the National Single Window poses challenges due to the involvement of multiple
agencies in both systems. To facilitate integration, BIDA can take an initiative to identify potential
integration points. If both systems function effectively, it could positively impact investors by
enhancing the ease of doing business in Bangladesh. However, achieving fully functional and integrated
systems, as seen in countries like Singapore with their 'TradeNet,' may take time. “TradeNet’ serves as
Singapore's National Single Window for trade declarations, streamlining regulatory compliance for
imports, exports, and transshipments. By providing a single point of entry for submitting declarations
to multiple regulatory agencies, ‘TradeNet’ significantly reduces the time and cost associated with
preparing, submitting, and processing trade documents.

5.15 Taxation and VAT Policies

During a dialogue organized by the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in
August 2023, speakers highlighted the importance of creating a more tax-friendly environment in
Bangladesh to stimulate both local and foreign direct investments (FDI).

To attract investors who are considering relocation, several countries have revamped their tax policies.
For instance, India has significantly reduced its corporate tax rate from 30% to 22%, and newly
established industrial enterprises enjoy an even lower tax rate of 17%**. Additionally, unlike
Bangladesh, countries such as India, Vietnam, and Thailand do not impose VAT requirements on
industries operating within economic zones. This competitive landscape necessitates a reconsideration
of corporate tax rates and VAT policies in Bangladesh to foster a surge in FDI inflows.

5.16 Encouraging Participation of Women in Foreign Investment

The concept ‘SheTrades’ is an initiative launched by the International Trade Centre (ITC) with the aim
of promoting and facilitating the involvement of women in international trade which recognizes the
potential of women entrepreneurs and business leaders to contribute significantly to economic growth
and development but acknowledges that they face unique challenges in accessing global markets.

This concept focuses on empowering women economically by enhancing their participation in
international trade through various strategies. One such initiative is encouraging women’s participation
in international investment to attract FDI. After examining the BIDA Acct, it is found that this act
partially addressed this issue through incorporating women member in the different committees. But
this issue could also be addressed in the One Stop Service Act, 2018. Moreover, several measures could
also be taken to address the issue of women participation through different policy support measures
such as gender-inclusive regulations and incentives for investors led or owned by women. In addition,
networking opportunities could also be developed through creating platforms and networks that
facilitate connections between women entrepreneurs, investors, and relevant stakeholders in the
international investment landscape. In the future amendment of the BIDA Act including the OSS Act,
such initiatives could be considered.

5.17 Infrastructural Gaps discouraging Foreign Investment

Attracting FDI is paramount for Bangladesh's economic growth. However, existing infrastructural gaps,
particularly in logistics and transportation, present significant barriers. Complex regulations and
restrictions hinder the development of logistics services, discouraging FDI inflows into this pivotal
sector. In 2018, Bangladesh ranked 100th in the Logistics Performance Index56 whereas in the same
region India ranked 44th. Trade in Bangladesh is paper-heavy and not automated. With the absence
of an adequate computerized system, Bangladesh is not realizing the full economic benefits of trade
facilitation. In addition, the staff lacks the capacity for new techniques, approaches, and customs
practices and procedures.

The Dhaka-Chittagong Corridor (DCC) is a critical component of Bangladesh's trade landscape,
handling nearly 66% of the nation's import and export activities. Logistical inefficiencies within the
DCC have hindered the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI). These inefficiencies result in
increased costs, delivery delays, logistical instability, and operational challenges for manufacturing
facilities. The congested conditions in Dhaka exacerbate these issues, and rail transport remains a
limited option.

Chittagong Port, serving as the primary gateway, manages over 90% of Bangladesh's foreign trade.
Data from World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence indicate that Bangladesh’s main seaport in
Chittagong is Asia’s least efficient port. However, despite its significance, Chittagong Port faces
challenges in terms of transportation conditions and related services, marked by complexities, lengthy
procedures, stringent customs regulations, and corruption. Logistical inefficiencies within the DCC
have hindered the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI). These inefficiencies result in increased
costs, delivery delays, logistical instability , and operational challenges for manufacturing facilities. The
congested conditions in Dhaka exacerbate these issues, and rail transport remains a limited option.“
The facilitation of foreign investment, particularly in sectors like agriculture and pharmaceuticals, relies
heavily on the establishment of a robust logistics and cold chain infrastructure. However, Bangladesh
faces formidable challenges in its existing logistics system, marked by regulatory complexities and
restricted access to Inland Container Depots (ICD) for managing perishable imports. Through the
simplification of regulations and the introduction of incentives for investments in cold chain facilities,
Bangladesh can significantly enhance its capacity to export perishable commodities such as fruits,

vegetables, pharmaceuticals, and premium meat. Such improvements will not only make the nation
more attractive to foreign investors but will also elevate its overall economic development prospects .**

Besides, to address congestion and operational challenges, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB)
initiated projects to develop new deep-sea ports in Matarbari and Payra. Furthermore, efforts are
underway to enhance Chittagong Port's capacity. Inland Container Depots (ICDs) and Container Freight
Stations (CFSs) have been encouraged to alleviate congestion. However, these facilities also experience
congestion, necessitating plans for additional container terminals.

Though rail transport offers a promising mode for container movement between Chittagong Port and
Dhaka, characterized by lower freight rates, reduced cargo damage risk, and enhanced customs services,
its utilization falls short al due to limited train frequency and short train lengths, attributed to various
constraints. Firstly, the existing wagon braking system imposes a speed limit of just 29 km/h, inhibiting
efficient transportation. Additionally, the railway-linked Inland Container Depot (ICD) located in
Dhaka faces limitations in handling capacity, causing delays and inefficiencies in cargo movement.
Furthermore, certain sections of the railway system, primarily serving passenger trains, experience high
demand while grappling with a shortage of wagons and locomotives. This dual pressure hampers the
railway's ability to provide timely and reliable freight services.**

Additionally, the lack of research and development (R&D) infrastructure is identified as a significant
barrier to the growth of industries in Bangladesh. Moreover, need for greater investment in digital
infrastructure, collaboration between stakeholders, and the development of a holistic digital strategy to
streamline port operations and enhance trade facilitation in Bangladesh.*’ Diversifying exports beyond
the RMG sector, addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and promoting sustainable
urbanization all hinge on a robust and efficient infrastructure. Given Bangladesh's vulnerability to
climate change and natural disasters, investments in resilient infrastructure are imperative. Green
growth strategies are essential for ensuring the sustainability of development outcomes for future
generations.

5.18 Institutional Challenges within BIDA

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) faces key institutional challenges as
follows. Enhancing these areas is vital for BIDA's role in investment promotion, facilitation, and policy
advocacy.

Manpower Shortage: Frequent officer transfers hinder knowledge continuity. Strengthening BIDA's
team through capacity development and expanded roles is essential.

Internal Coordination: A key challenge is coordinating between HQ and Divisional Offices for human
resource development and information management. Although HQ organizes training for officials,
Divisional Office staff should also be included. Due to their proximity, Divisional Offices have a crucial
role in interacting with registered foreign companies and communicating with domestic and foreign

investors. There should be a coordination mechanism for HQ-registered investors, facilitating
information sharing and Divisional Offices' monitoring responsibilities.

Integration of OSS Services: BIDA's One-Stop Service (OSS) is underutilized due to incomplete
integration of procedures and insufficient coordination with other authorities.

Investment Monitoring: Effective monitoring is necessary to track investment progress and address
issues faced by investors. This data is crucial for improving services and policy reform.

After-care: Post-registration support for investors is lacking. BIDA should establish mechanisms for
regular communication and updates to investors.

Disseminated Information Quality: Enhancing the quality and practicality of information provided to
investors is crucial, including details on market size and investment procedures.

Being under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister’s Office, BIDA is in a strategic position to
exert more influence on institutional frameworks, which could significantly enhance the investment
climate.

allows foreign investors to transfer
funds abroad when concluding their
direct investment activities in the
country. To be eligible for such a
transfer, the Vietnamese company that
received the investment must first
fulfill its financial obligations to the
State in accordance with Vietnamese
regulations. Additionally, the company
is required to submit audited financial
statements and enterprise income tax
declarations to the relevant
Vietnamese tax authorities. It must

stipulated by the Law on Tax
Management. This policy ensures that
investors can smoothly exit their

Dispute Settlement: A variety of

7. Findings from the Primary Survey (KII and FGD)

Institutional Capacity of BIDA: BIDA has been proactive in its initiatives to attract foreign
investment. They conduct roadshows, seminars, and pre-consultation stages to provide investors with
information and promote the advantages of investing in Bangladesh. Furthermore, BIDA is developing
an Investment Relationship Management Software, which will facilitate online communication between
BIDA and investors, allowing for profile sharing, inquiry submission, matchmaking, and feedback.
BIDA's after-care wing offers support for operational investments, and an online monitoring form
within the OSS system helps keep investor information updated. However, there are no mandated
services related to Aftercare that have been established, though a report published by JICA in 2022 has
indicated that an Investment After Care Unit has been set up.”

BIDA has received positive feedback for its timely services and guidance related to OSS and its website.
No issues have been reported in accessing OSS services. However, KII respondents have recommended
capacity building initiatives to build on technical expertise. Moreover, to retain institutional knowledge,
permanent technical staff should be appointed. Moreover, for the convenience of investors, BIDA’s
official website may include a detailed tutorial video for OSS usage. Concerns have been raised about
insufficient manpower and an outdated website at BIDA, emphasizing the need for marketing strategies
to enhance visibility and appeal to foreign investors.

Startup procedures and corporate forms are governed by the Companies Act (1994). Establishing a
company typically follows a standard process, including name clearance, filing company documents
(such as the name clearance certificate and memorandum/articles of association) for registration with
the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSCF), registering with the National Board of
Revenue (NBR) for corporate taxation (tax identification number) and VAT (VAT code), and obtaining
permits from the Bangladesh Bank (BB). Additionally, the paid-up capital of the new company must
be deposited in a local bank, and an encashment letter must be issued. Some of these licensing
procedures are now available online, which has significantly reduced processing times. To further
expedite the company establishment process (startup), the Government of Bangladesh enacted the OSS
Act 2018. Despite recent online improvements, the length and costs associated with startup procedures
continue to rank Bangladesh at 131st place on the "Starting a Business" indicator in the Doing Business
2018 report. Similarly, the country ranks 130th on the "Dealing with Construction Permits" indicator.
Foreign investors have raised concerns about the unclear procedures and lengthy processing times for
some licenses.

In terms of repatriation of money, while exiting is relatively straightforward, the process of repatriating
funds can be time-consuming and requires approval from BIDA. Issues related to exit laws and tax
avoidance have been cited as potential deterrents for foreign investors. BIDA is actively working to
expedite commercial dispute resolution by proposing a dedicated commercial court, which is in its final
stages of development. The existing tax avoidance process is recognized as requiring substantial time
and is seen as a discouragement for foreign investors.

Inter-agency Coordination: Effective coordination among Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs)
poses challenges, particularly in the realm of issuing import licenses. Despite BIDA's recommendations
to relevant stakeholders, there is a lack of adequate responsiveness. Unfortunately, BIDA faces
limitations in terms of legal mandate and decision-making authority, impeding its ability to directly

assist foreign investors. Although the OSS Act mentions a monitoring committee chaired by the finance
minister, meetings have yet to be convened. To enhance collaboration and provide investors with
transparent information, BIDA is working towards establishing a unified window for improved IPA
coordination. 40% of KII participants suggested that there is room for improving inter-agency
coordination regarding the OSS. 15% of respondents said that a monitoring mechanism, preferably
cross-institutional, needs to be set up to maintain the quality of services.

One Stop Service (OSS): Investors' interaction with the One-Stop Service (OSS) begins after securing
land in an economic zone, initiating a streamlined process for investment. They can apply for investment
clearance online, receive tax receipts, and obtain approvals for land use planning and building
construction, all accessible online. Similarly, online procedures are available for machinery imports and
the issuance of commercial operation certificates. Integration efforts with various departments,
including the Environmental Department, Fire Department, and Surokkha, are underway, with some
nearing completion. Key focal points within these departments play a pivotal role in assisting investors,
and collaboration with ministries and agencies has led to the establishment of a Standard Operating
System. Technical support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been
instrumental through consultancy services.

The adequacy of the current policy framework is emphasized, but there is room for improvement in
service timelines, as the target of providing services within 7 days often falls short. Consistency in
policies is stressed to avoid creating a negative impact on foreign investors. Despite challenges, the
OSS initiative is praised for providing legal compliances through a single window, and the Bangladesh
Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) has been acknowledged for addressing issues within the banking
system.

Challenges Faced by Investors: Stakeholders in Bangladesh have identified several challenges
affecting the business environment in the country. One significant issue is the complexity of the
Companies Act of 1994, which has posed difficulties for both local and foreign investors. It is suggested
that this act should be replaced with a more modern framework to facilitate business operations, similar
to the Indian Companies Act. Additionally, mismatches in financial years between Bangladesh and
India have led to confusion for Indian companies with subsidiaries in Bangladesh regarding double
taxation avoidance agreements. Outdated government websites have been a concern, affecting foreign
investors' perception of Bangladesh and hindering effective client interactions. Stakeholders emphasize
the need for more engagement with legal professionals in Bangladesh to promote foreign direct
investment. Concerns also arise from political instability, trust issues, government administrative
challenges, frequent policy changes, uncooperative junior government officials, lack of business
security , and bureaucratic hurdles. Land availability, security concerns, and complex interdependencies
among government organizations further contribute to the challenges faced by investors in Bangladesh.

International Best Practices: In the context of enhancing Bangladesh's investment climate and
attractiveness to foreign investors, stakeholders have put forth a series of valuable recommendations.
First and foremost, investors propose that Bangladesh consider aligning its legal framework with the
Indian Companies Act, a move aimed at simplifying business operations and regulations. This
alignment is expected to reduce complexities and improve the ease of conducting business for both
domestic and foreign investors. The successful implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
in India, conducted entirely online, serves as a noteworthy example. It underscores the potential
advantages of digitizing government processes, particularly in tax-related matters, offering
opportunities to streamline operations in Bangladesh.

51

&
e en
IPAG e «Sen

Drawing insights from China, stakeholders highlight the proactive role played by the Chinese
government in supporting business operations, particularly in relation to machinery imports. They
contend that similar governmental support in Bangladesh, especially concerning machinery imports,
could substantially enhance the overall investment environment. Additionally, stakeholders suggest
considering Malaysia's practice of accommodating foreigners by allowing them to engage in activities
outside of local cultural norms. This approach could significantly enhance the experience for foreign
investors and professionals working in Bangladesh, contributing to a more welcoming and inclusive
business environment.

Despite economic challenges, Sri Lanka has effectively addressed certain issues through its economic
strategies. Stakeholders recommend studying and learning from Sri Lanka's experiences to better
understand how to tackle challenges and create opportunities within Bangladesh's economic landscape.
Lastly, stakeholders underscore the importance of compiling a comprehensive list of incentives offered
by other nations to gain insights into international competitive advantages. This knowledge can guide
Bangladesh in tailoring its incentive offerings strategically, thus making the country a more compelling
destination for foreign investors.

Changes in Policies: Bangladesh has made efforts to strengthen IP rights protection over the years, but
it still faces some challenges. The country is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
has implemented various international agreements related to IP rights, such as the Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). These agreements require member countries,
including Bangladesh, to provide a minimum level of protection for IP rights. While the legal
framework for IP rights protection exists, effective enforcement remains a challenge due to factors like
limited resources and capacity. 15% respondents believe a robust legal framework for IPR will attract
foreign companies and investors after LDC graduation in 2026.

As per several respondents, Bangladesh needs to consider the fact that it will lose special treatment after
LDC graduation in 2026. Therefore, to retain investment and trade, it is imperative the government
considers signing free trade agreements, preferential trade agreements, or regional treaties/agreements.
Signing agreements will benefit Bangladesh especially in the case of technology transfer, investments,
and transfer of knowledge. Respondents have specifically suggested signing an FTA with Viet Nam to
benefit from knowledge transfer. Moreover, KII respondents have expressed that Bangladesh should
sign more Double Taxation Treaties and follow Viet Nam as an example in this regard as Viet Nam has
signed over 80 DTTs and Bangladesh has signed only 40 till date. Similar views have been reflected in
FGD findings.

Tax Incentives (NBR’s Perspective): As indicated in a KII with an officer from the National Board of
Revenue (NBR), the NBR is key in promoting investments through tax policies, essential for sector
growth and consumer welfare. Currently, the NBR is revising tax exemptions to increase revenue and
efficiency. This includes setting strict guidelines for tax breaks and streamlining exemptions,
particularly in value-added tax and import duties, to prevent misuse and support local industries.
Moreover, he stated that the tariff system is quite well-structured with varying tax rates for different
goods: under 5% for raw materials, 5-15% for intermediate goods, and 15-25% for finished products.

Trade Diversification Prospects: In assessing Bangladesh's economic landscape, several noteworthy
investment prospects have come to light. Firstly, there is substantial untapped potential within the
chemical industry, characterized by its relatively lower capital requirements, making it an appealing
avenue for diversification and expansion. A strategic move forward involves exploring opportunities
for backward integration with existing pharmaceutical companies, which has the potential to stimulate
substantial growth within the chemical sector. Additionally, there are compelling opportunities within

52

&

the IT sphere, spanning software, hardware, mobile assembly, cables, and telecommunications sectors.
Lastly, the freelance sector, which plays a pivotal role in contributing to remittances, should be subject
to effective government monitoring. This monitoring, underpinned by meticulous regulation, is crucial
to ensuring the sector's sustainability and its positive impact on Bangladesh's economy.

Customs Clearance Concerns: KII findings have shed light on the prolonged clearance time for
imports as a major issue. One respondent briefly mentioned how a study done by the World Customs
Organization revealed that while customs procedures take up a minor portion of the time, the pre-
declaration stage, mainly the Bill of Entry submission, constitutes the bulk of the delay.

8. Recommendations/ Way Forward

Improvement of Investment Climate

Increasing Manpower and Capacity Building Programs: Concerns were raised about
insufficient manpower to operate within BIDA, which may be addressed through recruitment
of permanent employees who are not subjected to frequent transfers.

Capacity Building and Training: BIDA can conduct a few capacity building and training
sessions on investment promotion activities, methods, and proactive service delivery which will
be applicable for all officers working at IPAs.

Policy Advocacy: Policy advocacy is considered one of the vital functions that BIDA is
expected to fulfill. This involves the formulation of investment policies and the facilitation of
regulatory reforms to benefit investors. Among government institutions, BIDA is uniquely
positioned to take the lead in policy advocacy. This role extends beyond merely participating
in policy dialogues between the public and private sectors. In this regard, BIDA can establish
regular channels of communication with investors to gather their feedback and demands
concerning government policies and regulations related to investments. Subsequently, BIDA
can identify commonly observed issues and propose policies or measures to address these
challenges. They can then submit these proposals to the relevant authorities responsible for
policy and regulatory reforms.

Streamlined Administrative Processes: To fully realize the benefits of incentives, there is
emphasis on streamlining administrative processes responsible for delivering these benefits.
Investors should be handled on a case-by-case basis to ensure they are briefed adequately.
Simplifying and expediting these procedures can encourage more investors to choose
Bangladesh as their investment destination. In addition, BIDA may update its existing
handbook/ guidebook to document streamlined procedures.

Dispute resolution: Foreign investors in Bangladesh favor arbitration over litigation for
dispute resolution due to judicial delays. The FPIPPA 1980 ensures fair treatment but lacks
specific investor-state dispute provisions. Investors often use the Arbitration Act of 2001 and
2004, ICSID, and the New York Convention for disputes. The Bangladesh International
Arbitration Centre (BIAC) handles commercial disputes locally. To enhance protection, explicit
dispute resolution clauses in the FPIPPA and the BIDA Act are needed, including a grievance
redress system within the OSS framework and a provision for High Court or commercial
tribunal jurisdiction over BIDA-related grievances.

Separate Cell or Court for Dispute Resolution: The High Court may establish a dedicated
court or cell solely responsible for dealing with foreign investments related disputes. This
would speed up the process and encourage investors to continue business in Bangladesh.

Exit Policy: An investor has the option to terminate their investment through a resolution
passed at either an annual or special general meeting. After fulfilling the necessary exit
procedures in Bangladesh, a foreign investor is permitted to transfer the net proceeds out of the
country, provided they have obtained the requisite authorization Bangladesh Bank. While the
Exit Policy is relatively smooth, the process becomes complicated due to the process of outward
remittance.

Cross-Institutional Monitoring: The government is urged to employ cross-institutional
monitoring systems to oversee and prevent procedural hindrances. BIDA may conduct or
oversee the process of monitoring in this regard.

Improving Inter-Agency Coordination: To address challenges in sectors like IT, software,
hardware, and telecommunications, stakeholders recommend improving coordination among
government organizations. Reducing interdependencies and fostering a culture of timely
service delivery can enhance the investment climate.

IPAG e «Sen

e Promote women's participation: Advocate for increased participation in foreign investment
through gender-inclusive policies, regulations, and initiatives such as SheTrades.

e International Best Practices: Several countries in the region provide valuable insights for
enhancing Bangladesh's investment climate. For instance, Malaysia's practice of
accommodating foreigners by allowing them to enjoy recreational activities outside local
cultural norms could contribute to a more welcoming environment for foreign investors and
professionals in Bangladesh. Additionally, Thailand and Vietnam have undertaken policy
reforms to create investor-friendly business climates, actively promoting their strongest sectors
to attract investments. Vietnam's extensive network of double taxation treaties (DTTs) with
around 80 countries compared to Bangladesh's 40 underscores the need for Bangladesh to
expand its DIT coverage. Furthermore, revising tax and value-added tax (VAT) policies,
following the example of countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, by offering lower
corporate taxes and VAT exemptions in economic zones, could significantly boost both local
and foreign investments in Bangladesh. These insights from neighboring countries provide
valuable guidance for Bangladesh's efforts to attract and retain foreign investment.

Post LDC Measures:

e Free Trade Agreement or Preferential Trade Agreements: Bilateral agreements with other
countries can lead to tariff relaxation, reducing the cost of doing business for both parties.

e Intellectual Property Rights: Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) enforcement has a flexible
framework, but foreign investors need to be aware of these facilities, particularly in the Hi-
Tech industries. Policy reforms and addressing IPR issues may attract multinational
corporations.

e Diplomatic Channels: Build strategic alliances with countries such as Vietnam and use
consulates, embassies, and missions to promote investment and international business
understanding (knowledge and technology transfer).

e Exploring Diversification Opportunities: There is potential for diversification, especially in
industries like chemicals and IT. Recommendations include promoting backward integration
with existing industries and addressing specific sectoral barriers.

e Establish Backward Linkages: Bangladesh can still process other materials locally,
functioning as a substitute for imports. This strategy eliminates the need to import raw
materials, subsequently reducing lead times and costs. By manufacturing products locally, it
ensures diversification within the domestic market. Additionally, other countries might also
find value in these backward linkage products, leading to an expansion of Bangladesh's export
portfolio. Bangladesh might have limited natural resources, the country.

e Technology transfer: To diversify its industries, Bangladesh needs to focus on industrial

9. Conclusion

In conclusion, this report has provided a comprehensive analysis of the current state of foreign
investment in Bangladesh, shedding light on various aspects of its investment landscape. It has not only
recognized the achievements and progress that Bangladesh has made in attracting FDI but also
identified several areas that require attention and improvement to further boost its position as an
attractive investment destination. Bangladesh has undoubtedly made significant strides in creating a
conducive environment for foreign investors. The establishment of BIDA and the enactment of the One
Stop Service (OSS) Act in 2018 represent significant milestones in this regard. These initiatives have
simplified administrative procedures, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and enhanced the overall ease of
doing business in the country. Moreover, Bangladesh's proactive approach in signing bilateral
investment treaties (BITs) and engaging in regional trade agreements demonstrates its commitment to
providing a secure and reliable investment climate.

However, this report has also shed light on certain challenges that persist. While Bangladesh has made
strides in this area, further improvements are necessary to ensure that investors have access to timely
and impartial dispute resolution processes. One of these challenges is the need for an efficient and
effective inter-agency coordination mechanism. Streamlining communication and collaboration among
various government bodies involved in foreign investment promotion and facilitation is crucial to
provide a seamless experience for investors. Findings have revealed a compelling need for improved
coordination among various government agencies engaged in the OSS process. This lack of
coordination has resulted in service delays, negatively impacting the investor experience and potentially
discouraging foreign investment. Hence, incorporating inter-agency coordination provisions into the
BIDA Act can further enhance the effectiveness of the OSS. The complexities surrounding outward
remittances and profit repatriation have been highlighted in this report. While regulations and guidelines
exist, there is room for simplification and clarification of these processes like Viet Name, Malaysia and
Thailand, which can significantly benefit investors and contribute to a more investor-friendly
environment.

In terms of dispute settlement, Bangladesh faces challenges with its judicial system's independence and
efficiency, leading foreign investors to prefer arbitration for resolving cross-border commercial
disputes. Foreign investors in Bangladesh prefer arbitration due to delays in the local litigation process.
Bangladesh offers various dispute resolution options, including the 2001 and 2004 Arbitration Acts,
participation in ICSID, the ability to use third-country forums like Singapore for dispute settlement, and
membership in the SAARC Agreement for an Arbitration Council since 2005. Bangladesh is also a
signatory to the New York Convention, recognizing international arbitration awards! enforcement. The
FPIPPA currently lacks any provisions for investor-state disputes, which are typically found in bilateral
agreements. A provision on investor-state dispute should be explicitly stated in the Act and designed to
be as comprehensive as possible, providing foreign investors with ample freedom and protection. In
most treaties, parties’ consent to settling investor-state disputes through international arbitration
mechanisms, typically ICSID. When investors commit significant funds to a project, they often seek
legal support to ensure their protection. They may not solely rely on the FPIPPA for clarity and may
refer to other documents like bilateral investment treaties or joint investment agreements. Furthermore,
the OSS can incorporate a grievance redress system aimed at addressing investor concerns and resolving
them.

The integration of the One Stop Service (OSS) with the National Single Window, as mandated by the
World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), is a positive step toward modernizing

80

international trade processes. Nonetheless, addressing the challenges arising from the involvement of
multiple agencies in both systems is essential to fully realize the potential benefits of this integration.

Research indicates that IP plays a multifaceted role in fostering FDI, with several facets underscoring
its importance in drawing and maintaining investments. Given this evidence, it is advisable for
Bangladesh to prioritize robust Intellectual Property protection as a means to attract higher levels of
FDI.

FDI plays a vital role in transferring necessary technology for this purpose. Bangladesh can learn from
Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, which have provisions for technology transfer through the
Foreign Business Act of 1999. To facilitate better technology transfer, improving the investment
environment is crucial. This involves simplifying the repatriation of royalties and fees, streamlining
expatriate work permits, revising import tariffs, and strengthening connections between FDI assemblers
and local suppliers. Establishing a dedicated division within IPAs for linkages is also essential.

Furthermore, this report has emphasized the importance of promoting women's participation in foreign
investment. Initiatives like "SheTrades" highlight the significant role that women entrepreneurs and
leaders can play in contributing to economic growth and development. Incorporating gender-inclusive
provisions into relevant policies and regulations is essential to create a more equitable and inclusive
investment environment.

Lastly, aligning Bangladesh's foreign investment practices with established international standards is
key to enhancing its competitiveness in the global investment landscape. By benchmarking against
global best practices and adopting necessary reforms, Bangladesh can continue to attract foreign
investment and stimulate economic growth. Thailand and Malaysia have successfully diversified their
economies. Thailand has moved from agriculture-based to more technology and manufacturing-driven,
while Malaysia has transitioned into higher-value industries like electronics, automotive, and medical
devices. Bangladesh can emulate this by diversifying its economy beyond the textile sector.

In conclusion, Bangladesh has made notable progress in attracting foreign investment, and there is
immense potential for further growth. The recommendations outlined in this report serve as a roadmap
for the government and relevant stakeholders to address the identified challenges and capitalize on the
opportunities. By implementing these recommendations and fostering an environment that is
welcoming, efficient, and inclusive, Bangladesh can position itself as a prime destination for foreign
investment, driving economic prosperity and development for the nation and its people.
