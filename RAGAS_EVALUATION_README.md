# RAGAS Evaluation Framework

This document provides an overview of the RAGAS evaluation framework implemented in this project to assess the performance of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## 1. Location of the RAGAS Evaluation Script

The RAGAS evaluation script is located at: `tests/ragas_evaluation.py`

## 2. How to Run the RAGAS Evaluation

To run the RAGAS evaluation, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python tests/ragas_evaluation.py
```

## 3. How it Works

The `tests/ragas_evaluation.py` script performs the following steps:

1.  **Initializes the `FinancialAdvisorBot`**: It creates an instance of the bot to be tested.
2.  **Defines a Test Dataset**: It uses a predefined set of questions and corresponding "ground truth" answers to evaluate the bot's performance.
3.  **Processes Queries**: It iterates through the test questions and uses the `FinancialAdvisorBot` to generate answers and retrieve source documents (contexts).
4.  **Prepares Data for RAGAS**: It formats the questions, answers, contexts, and ground truths into a `Dataset` object that RAGAS can understand.
5.  **Configures RAGAS**: It configures RAGAS to use the same Ollama LLM and HuggingFace embedding model as the main application, ensuring that the evaluation is performed in the same environment.
6.  **Runs the Evaluation**: It uses the `ragas.evaluate()` function to assess the RAG system against the following metrics:
    *   **Faithfulness**: Measures how factually accurate the generated answer is based on the provided context.
    *   **Answer Relevancy**: Measures how relevant the generated answer is to the question.
    *   **Context Recall**: Measures the extent to which the retrieved context contains all the information needed to answer the question.
    *   **Context Precision**: Measures the signal-to-noise ratio of the retrieved context.
7.  **Prints the Results**: It prints a report to the console with the scores for each metric.

## 4. Current Results and Interpretation

The current RAGAS evaluation produces the following results:

*   **Faithfulness**: `NaN`
*   **Answer Relevancy**: `0.0`
*   **Context Recall**: `~0.6`
*   **Context Precision**: `NaN`

The `NaN` values for `faithfulness` and `context_precision` suggest that the language model (`llama3.2:1b-extended`) may not be powerful enough to generate the intermediate data required for these metrics. The `answer_relevancy` score of `0.0` is a concern and indicates that the bot's answers may not be relevant to the questions.

The `context_recall` score of `~0.6` is a more positive result, suggesting that the RAG system is able to retrieve a significant portion of the relevant context.

## 5. Future Improvements

To improve the RAGAS evaluation and the overall performance of the RAG system, consider the following:

*   **Use a More Powerful LLM**: A more capable language model may be able to generate the necessary data for the `faithfulness` and `context_precision` metrics, providing a more complete evaluation.
*   **Improve Answer Relevancy**: The low `answer_relevancy` score suggests that the bot's answers need to be more focused on the questions. This could be addressed by fine-tuning the prompt or using a more advanced answer generation technique.
*   **Expand the Test Dataset**: A larger and more diverse test dataset would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the RAG system's performance.
