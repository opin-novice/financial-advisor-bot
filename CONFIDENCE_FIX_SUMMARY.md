# Telegram Bot Confidence Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Your Telegram bot was being overly conservative and returning generic "I'm not confident in my answer" messages even when it had found relevant documents about the user's question (like tax filing procedures).

## Root Cause
The bot was using **confidence thresholds that were too high** (0.3) in the answer validation logic, causing it to reject perfectly good answers and replace them with generic messages.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Lowered Confidence Thresholds in Main Bot Logic (`main.py`)
- **Changed confidence threshold from 0.3 to 0.15** in both:
  - `_process_query_with_feedback_loop()` (lines 342-343)
  - `_process_query_traditional()` (lines 397-398)

- **Added intelligent fallback logic**: When confidence is between 0.05-0.15, the bot now:
  - Provides the actual answer with a disclaimer instead of generic rejection
  - Only shows the generic message if confidence is extremely low (\u003c0.05)

### 2. Updated Configuration Default Values (`config.py`)
- **Lowered default relevance threshold from 0.3 to 0.2**
- **Lowered default confidence threshold from 0.2 to 0.15**
- **Updated performance mode configurations**:
  - Balanced mode: relevance 0.3→0.2, confidence 0.2→0.15
  - Thorough mode: relevance 0.2→0.15, confidence 0.15→0.1

### 3. Improved Prompt Template (`main.py`)
- **Enhanced instructions** to encourage helpful responses even with partial information
- **Added guidance** to "extract and synthesize useful information" 
- **Improved fallback instructions** for limited information scenarios
- **Made prompt more action-oriented** and practical

### 4. Updated Environment Configuration (`.env.example`)
- **Updated default values** to reflect the new lower thresholds
- **Documented recommended settings** for better bot performance

## Results
✅ **Test Successful**: The bot now provides helpful, detailed answers about tax filing procedures instead of generic "not confident" messages.

## Example Behavior Change

### Before Fix:
```
User: "How to file my taxes?"
Bot: "I'm not confident in my answer based on the available information. Please rephrase your question or ask about a different topic."
```

### After Fix:
```
User: "How to file my taxes?"
Bot: "I'd be happy to help you with that!

To file your taxes, you'll need to follow the steps outlined in the Tax Filing Procedures Step-by-Step Guide for Individual Tax Filing. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Determine Tax Liability**: Calculate your total income from all sources and check if your income exceeds the taxable threshold...

```

## Key Benefits
1. **More helpful responses** - Users get actual answers instead of generic rejections
2. **Intelligent confidence handling** - Low confidence answers include disclaimers but still provide value
3. **Maintained accuracy** - Still rejects extremely low quality answers (\u003c0.05 confidence)
4. **Better user experience** - Users can get information and decide for themselves rather than being blocked

## Configuration
The bot now uses these improved default thresholds:
- **Relevance Threshold**: 0.2 (was 0.3)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.15 (was 0.3 in validation logic)
- **Feedback Loop Settings**: More lenient across all performance modes

Your bot should now be much more helpful while still maintaining reasonable quality standards!
